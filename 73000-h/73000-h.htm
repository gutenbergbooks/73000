<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>Some years ago I was thinking of a little book, which now may or may
not ever get itself finished, about Shakespeare and the conditions,
literary and dramatic, under which Shakespeare wrote. My proper
task would have begun with the middle of the sixteenth century. But
it seemed natural to put first some short account of the origins
of play-acting in England and of its development during the Middle
Ages. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that the basis for such a
narrative was wanting. The history of the mediaeval theatre had never,
from an English point of view, been written. The initial chapter of
Collier’s <i>Annals of the Stage</i> is even less adequate than is
usual with this slovenly and dishonest antiquary. It is with some
satisfaction that, in spite of the barrier set up by an incorrect
reference, I have resolved one dramatic representation elaborately
described by Collier into a <i>soteltie</i> or sweetmeat. More
scholarly writers, such as Dr. A. W. Ward, while dealing excellently
with the mediaeval drama as literature, have shown themselves but
little curious about the social and economic facts upon which the
mediaeval drama rested. Yet from a study of such facts, I am sure, any
literary history, which does not confine itself solely to the analysis
of genius, must make a start.</p>

<p>An attempt of my own to fill the gap has grown into these two
volumes, which have, I fear, been unduly swelled by the inclusion
of new interests as, from time to time, they took hold upon me; an
interest, for example, in the light-hearted and coloured life of those
<i>poverelli</i> of letters, the minstrel folk; a very deep interest
in the track across the ages of certain customs and symbols of rural
gaiety which bear with them the inheritance of a remote and ancestral
heathenism. I can only hope that this disproportionate treatment of
parts has not wholly destroyed the unity of purpose at which, after
all, I aimed. If I may venture to define for myself the formula of
my work, I would say that it endeavours to state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span> and explain the
pre-existing conditions which, by the latter half of the sixteenth
century, made the great Shakespearean stage possible. The story is
one of a sudden dissolution and a slow upbuilding. I have arranged
the material in four Books. The First Book shows how the organization
of the Graeco-Roman theatre broke down before the onslaught of
Christianity and the indifference of barbarism, and how the actors
became wandering minstrels, merging with the gleemen of their Teutonic
conquerors, entertaining all classes of mediaeval society with
<i>spectacula</i> in which the dramatic element was of the slightest,
and in the end, after long endurance, coming to a practical compromise
with the hostility of the Church. In the Second Book I pass to
<i>spectacula</i> of another type, which also had to struggle against
ecclesiastical disfavour, and which also made their ultimate peace with
all but the most austere forms of the dominant religion. These are
the <i>ludi</i> of the village feasts, bearing witness, not only to
their origin in heathen ritual, but also, by their constant tendency
to break out into primitive forms of drama, to the deep-rooted mimetic
instinct of the folk. The Third Book is a study of the process by
which the Church itself, through the introduction of dramatic elements
into its liturgy, came to make its own appeal to this same mimetic
instinct; and of that by which, from such beginnings, grew up the great
popular religious drama of the miracle-plays, with its offshoots in
the moralities and the dramatic pageants. The Fourth and final Book
deals summarily with the transformation of the mediaeval stage, on
the literary side under the influence of humanism, on the social and
economic side by the emergence from amongst the ruins of minstrelsy of
a new class of professional players, in whose hands the theatre was
destined to recover a stable organization upon lines which had been
departed from since the days of Tertullian.</p>

<p>I am very conscious of the manifold imperfections of these volumes.
They are the work, not of a professed student, but of one who only
plays at scholarship in the rare intervals of a busy administrative
life. They owe much to the long-suffering officials of the British
Museum and the London Library, and more recently to the aid and
encouragement of the Delegates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span> of the Clarendon Press and their
accomplished staff. The literary side of the mediaeval drama, about
which much remains to be said, I have almost wholly neglected. I shall
not, I hope, be accused of attaching too much importance in the first
volume to the vague and uncertain results of folk-lore research.
One cannot be always giving expression to the minuter shades of
probability. But in any investigation the validity of the inferences
must be relative to the nature of the subject-matter; and, whether I
qualify it in words or not, I do not, of course, make a statement about
the intention, say, of primitive sacrifice, with the same confidence
which attaches to one about matters of historic record. The burden
of my notes and appendices sometimes appears to me intolerable. My
excuse is that I wanted to collect, once for all, as many facts with
as precise references as possible. These may, perhaps, have a value
independent of any conclusions which I have founded upon them. And
even now I do not suppose that I have been either exhaustive or
accurate. The remorseless ideal of the historian’s duties laid down
in the <i>Introduction aux Études Historiques</i> of MM. Langlois
and Seignobos floats before me like an accusing spirit. I know how
very far I am from having reached that austere standard of scientific
completeness. To begin with, I had not the necessary training. Oxford,
my most kindly nurse, maintained in my day no <i>École des Chartes</i>,
and I had to discover the rules of method as I went along. But the
greater difficulty has been the want of leisure and the spacious life.
Shades of Duke Humphrey’s library, how often, as I jostled for my turn
at the crowded catalogue-shelves of the British Museum, have I not
envied those whose lot it is to tread your ample corridors and to bend
over your yellowing folios! Amongst such happy scholars, the canons
of Clio may claim implicit obedience. A silent company, they ‘class’
their documents and ‘try’ their sources from morn to eve, disturbed
in the pleasant ways of research only by the green flicker of leaves
in the Exeter garden, or by the statutory inconvenience of a terminal
lecture.—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LIST_OF_AUTHORITIES">LIST OF AUTHORITIES</h2>
</div>


<p>[<i>General Bibliographical Note.</i> I mention here only a few works
of wide range, which may be taken as authorities throughout these
two volumes. Others, more limited in their scope, are named in the
preliminary notes to the sections of the book on whose subject-matter
they bear.—An admirable general history of the modern drama is W.
Creizenach’s still incomplete <i>Geschichte des neueren Dramas</i>
(Band i, <i>Mittelalter und Frührenaissance</i>, 1893; Bände ii, iii,
<i>Renaissance und Reformation</i>, 1901-3). R. Prölss, <i>Geschichte
des neueren Dramas</i> (1881-3), is slighter. The earlier work of
J. L. Klein, <i>Geschichte des Dramas</i> (13 vols. 1865-76), is
diffuse, inconvenient, and now partly obsolete. A valuable study
is expected from J. M. Manly in vol. iii of his <i>Specimens of
the Pre-Shakespearean Drama</i>, of which two volumes, containing
selected texts, appeared in 1897. C. Hastings, <i>Le Théâtre français
et anglais</i> (1900, Eng. trans. 1901), is a compilation of little
merit.—Prof. Creizenach may be supplemented for Germany by R.
Froning, <i>Das Drama des Mittelalters</i> (1891). For France there
are the exhaustive and excellent volumes of L. Petit de Julleville’s
<i>Histoire du Théâtre en France au Moyen Âge</i> (<i>Les Mystères</i>,
1880; <i>Les Comédiens en France au Moyen Âge</i>, 1885; <i>La
Comédie et les Mœurs en France au Moyen Âge</i>, 1886; <i>Répertoire
du Théâtre comique au Moyen Âge</i>, 1886). G. Bapst, <i>Essai sur
l’Histoire du Théâtre</i> (1893), adds some useful material on the
history of the stage. For Italy A. d’ Ancona, <i>Origini del Teatro
italiano</i> (2nd ed., 1891), is also excellent.—The best English
book is A. W. Ward’s <i>History of English Dramatic Literature to the
death of Queen Anne</i> (2nd ed., 1899). J. P. Collier, <i>History
of English Dramatic Poetry</i> (new ed., 1879), is full of matter,
but, for various reasons, not wholly trustworthy. J. J. Jusserand,
<i>Le Théâtre en Angleterre</i> (2nd ed., 1881), J. A. Symonds,
<i>Shakespeare’s Predecessors in the English Drama</i> (1884), and
G. M. Gayley, <i>Representative English Comedies</i> (1903), are of
value. Texts will be found in Manly’s and Gayley’s books, and in A.
W. Pollard, <i>English Miracle Plays, Moralities and Interludes</i>
(3rd ed., 1898); W. C. Hazlitt, <i>Dodsley’s Old Plays</i> (15 vols.
1874-6); A. Brandl, <i>Quellen des weltlichen Dramas in England</i>
(1898). F. H. Stoddard, <i>References for Students of Miracle
Plays and Mysteries</i> (1887), and K. L. Bates and L. B. Godfrey,
<i>English Drama; a Working Basis</i> (1896), are rough attempts at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
bibliographies.—In addition the drama of course finds treatment
in the general histories of literature. The best are: for Germany,
R. Kögel, <i>Geschichte der deutschen Literatur bis zum Ausgange
des Mittelalters</i> (1894-7, a fragment); K. Gödeke, <i>Grundriss
zur Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung aus den Quellen</i> (2nd ed.,
1884-1900); W. Scherer, <i>Geschichte der deutschen Litteratur</i> (8th
ed., 1899): for France, L. Petit de Julleville (editor), <i>Histoire
de la Langue et de la Littérature françaises</i> (1896-1900); G.
Paris, <i>La Littérature française au Moyen Âge</i> (2nd ed., 1890):
for Italy, A. Gaspary, <i>Geschichte der italienischen Litteratur</i>
(1884-9, Eng. transl. 1901): for England, T. Warton, <i>History of
English Poetry</i> (ed. W. C. Hazlitt, 1871); B. Ten Brink, <i>History
of English Literature</i> (Eng. trans. 1893-6); J. J. Jusserand,
<i>Literary History of the English People</i> (vol. i. 1895); W. J.
Courthope, <i>History of English Poetry</i> (vols. i, ii. 1895-7); G.
Saintsbury, <i>Short History of English Literature</i> (1898), and,
especially for bibliography, G. Körting, <i>Grundriss der Geschichte
der englischen Litteratur</i> (3rd ed., 1899). The <i>Periods of
European Literature</i>, edited by Prof. Saintsbury, especially G.
Gregory Smith, <i>The Transition Period</i> (1900), and the two
great <i>Grundrisse</i>, H. Paul, <i>Grundriss der germanischen
Philologie</i> (2nd ed., 1896-1903), and G. Gröber, <i>Grundriss der
romanischen Philologie</i> (1888-1903), should also be consulted.—The
beginnings of the mediaeval drama are closely bound up with liturgy,
and the nature of the liturgical books referred to is explained by W.
Maskell, <i>A Dissertation upon the Ancient Service-Books of the Church
of England</i> (in <i>Monumenta Ritualia Ecclesiae Anglicanae</i>, 2nd
ed., 1882, vol. iii); H. B. Swete, <i>Church Services and Service-Books
before the Reformation</i> (1896); Procter-Frere, <i>New History of
the Book of Common Prayer</i> (1901). The beginnings of Catholic
ritual are studied by L. Duchesne, <i>Origines du Culte chrétien</i>
(3rd ed., 1902, Eng. trans. 1903), and its mediaeval forms described
by D. Rock, <i>The Church of our Fathers</i> (1849-53), and J. D.
Chambers, <i>Divine Worship in England in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Centuries</i> (1877).</p>

<p>The following list of books is mainly intended to elucidate the
references in the footnotes, and has no claim to bibliographical
completeness or accuracy. I have included the titles of a few German
and French dissertations of which I have not been able to make use.]</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—A convenient sketch of the history
of the Roman stage will be found in G. Körting, <i>Geschichte
des griechischen und römischen Theaters</i> (1897). The details
given in L. Friedländer, <i>Sittengeschichte Roms in der Zeit von
August bis zum Ausgang der Antonine</i> (vol. ii, 7th ed. 1901),
and the same writer’s article on <i>Die Spiele</i> in vol. vi of
Marquardt and Mommsen’s <i>Handbuch der römischen Alterthümer</i>
(2nd ed. 1885), may be supplemented from E. Nöldechen’s
article <i>Tertullian und das Theater</i> in <i>Zeitschrift
für Kirchengeschichte</i>, xv (1894), 161, for the <i>fabulae
Atellanae</i> from A. Dieterich, <i>Pulcinella</i> (1897), chs.
4-8, and for the <i>pantomimi</i> from C. Sittl, <i>Die Gebärden
der Griechen und Römer</i> (1890), ch. 13. The account in C.
Magnin, <i>Les Origines du Théâtre moderne</i> (vol. i, all
published, 1838), is by no means obsolete. Teuffel and Schwabe,
<i>History of Latin Literature</i>, vol. i, §§ 3-18 (trans. G. C.
W. Warr, 1891), contains a mass of imperfectly arranged material.
The later history of the Greek stage is dealt with by P. E.
Müller, <i>Commentatio historica de genio, moribus et luxu aevi
Theodosiani</i> (1798), vol. ii, and A. E. Haigh, <i>Tragic Drama
of the Greeks</i> (1896), ch. 6. The ecclesiastical prohibitions
are collected by W. Prynne, <i>Histriomastix</i> (1633), and
J. de Douhet, <i>Dictionnaire des Mystères</i> (1854), and
their general attitude summarized by H. Alt, <i>Theater und
Kirche in ihrem gegenseitigen Verhältniss</i> (1846). S. Dill,
<i>Roman Society in the Last Century of the Roman Empire</i> (2nd
ed. 1899), should be consulted for an admirable study of the
conditions under which the pre-mediaeval stage came to an end.]</p>
</div>


<p>Christianity, emerging from Syria with a prejudice against
disguisings<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, found the Roman world full of <i>scenici</i>. The
mimetic instinct, which no race of mankind is wholly without, appears
to have been unusually strong amongst the peoples of the Mediterranean
stock. A literary drama came into being in Athens during the sixth
century, and established itself in city after city. Theatres were
built, and tragedies and comedies acted on the Attic model, wherever a
Greek foot trod, from Hipola in Spain to Tigranocerta in Armenia. The
great capitals of the later Greece, Alexandria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span> Antioch, Pergamum,
rivalled Athens itself in their devotion to the stage. Another
development of drama, independent of Athens, in Sicily and Magna
Graecia, may be distinguished as farcical rather than comic. After
receiving literary treatment at the hands of Epicharmus and Sophron
in the fifth century, it continued its existence under the name of
mime (μῖμος), upon a more popular level. Like many forms of popular
drama, it seems to have combined the elements of farce and morality.
Its exponents are described as buffoons (γελωτοποιοί, παιγνιογράφοι)
and dealers in indecencies (ἀναισχυντογράφοι), and again as concerning
themselves with questions of character and manners (ἠθολόγοι,
ἀρεταλόγοι). They even produced what sound singularly like problem
plays (ὑποθέσεις). Both qualities may have sprung from a common root in
the observation and audacious portrayal of contemporary life. The mime
was still flourishing in and about Tarentum in the third century<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Probably the Romans were not of the Mediterranean stock, and their
native <i>ludi</i> were athletic rather than mimetic. But the drama
gradually filtered in from the neighbouring peoples. Its earliest
stirrings in the rude farce of the <i>satura</i> are attributed by Livy
to Etruscan influence<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. From Campania came another type of farce,
the <i>Oscum ludicrum</i> or <i>fabula Atellana</i>, with its standing
masks of Maccus and Bucco, Pappus and Dossennus, in whom it is hard
not to find a kinship to the traditional personages of the Neapolitan
<i>commedia dell’ arte</i>. About 240 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> the Greek Livius
Andronicus introduced tragedy and comedy. The play now became a
regular element in the <i>spectacula</i> of the Roman festivals, only
subordinate in interest to the chariot-race and the gladiatorial show.
Permanent theatres were built in the closing years of the Republic by
Pompey and others, and the number of days annually devoted to <i>ludi
scenici</i> was constantly on the increase. From 48 under Augustus they
grew to 101 under Constantius. Throughout the period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> the Empire,
indeed, the theatre was of no small political importance. On the one
hand it was the rallying point of all disturbers of the peace and the
last stronghold of a public opinion debarred from the senate and the
forum; on the other it was a potent means for winning the affection
of the populace and diverting its attention from dynastic questions.
The <i>scenici</i> might be thorns in the side of the government, but
they were quite indispensable to it. If their perversities drove them
from Italy, the clamour of the mob soon brought them back again. Trajan
revealed one of the <i>arcana imperii</i> when he declared that the
<i>annona</i> and the <i>spectacula</i> controlled Rome<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. And what
was true of Rome was true of Byzantium, and in a lesser degree of the
smaller provincial cities. So long as the Empire itself held together,
the provision firstly of corn and secondly of novel <i>ludi</i>
remained one of the chief preoccupations of many a highly placed
official.</p>

<p>The vast popular audiences of the period under consideration cared but
little for the literary drama. In the theatre of Pompey, thronged with
slaves and foreigners of every tongue, the finer histrionic effects
must necessarily have been lost<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Something more spectacular and
sensuous, something appealing to a cruder sense of humour, almost
inevitably took their place. There is evidence indeed that, while the
theatres stood, tragedy and comedy never wholly disappeared from their
boards<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. But it was probably only the ancient masterpieces that got a
hearing. Even in Greece performances of new plays on classical models
cannot be traced beyond about the time of Hadrian. And in Rome the
tragic poets had long before then learnt to content themselves with
recitations and to rely for victims on the good nature, frequently
inadequate, of their friends<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. The stilted dramas of Seneca were
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> delight of the Renaissance, but it is improbable that, until the
Renaissance, they were ever dignified with representation. Roughly
speaking, for comedy and tragedy the Empire substituted farce and
pantomime.</p>

<p>Farce, as has been noticed, was the earliest traffic of the Roman
stage. The Atellane, relegated during the brief vogue of comedy and
tragedy to the position of an interlude or an afterpiece, now once
more asserted its independence. But already during the Republic the
Atellane, with its somewhat conventional and limited methods, was
beginning to give way to a more flexible and vital type of farce.
This was none other than the old mime of Magna Graecia, which now
entered on a fresh phase of existence and overran both West and East.
That it underwent considerable modifications, and probably absorbed
much both of Atellane and of Attic comedy, may be taken for granted.
Certainly it extended its scope to mythological themes. But its leading
characteristics remained unchanged. The ethical element, one may
fear, sank somewhat into the background, although it was by no means
absent from the work of the better mime-writers, such as Laberius and
Publilius Syrus<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. But that the note of shamelessness was preserved
there is no doubt whatever<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. The favourite theme, which is common
indeed to farce of all ages, was that of conjugal infidelity<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.
Unchaste scenes were represented with an astonishing realism<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Contrary to the earlier custom of the classical stage, women took part
in the performances, and at the <i>Floralia</i>, loosest of Roman
festivals, the spectators seem to have claimed it as their right
that the <i>mimae</i> should play naked<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. The <i>mimus</i>—for
the same term designates both piece and actor—was just the kind of
entertainer whom a democratic audience loves. Clad in a parti-coloured
<i>centunculus</i>, with no mask to conceal the play of facial gesture,
and <i>planipes</i>, with no borrowed dignity of sock or buskin, he
rattled through his side-splitting scenes of low life, and eked out
his text with an inexhaustible variety of rude dancing, buffoonery
and horse-play<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Originally the mimes seem to have performed in
monologues, and the action of their pieces continued to be generally
dominated by a single personage, the <i>archimimus</i>, who was
provided with certain <i>stupidi</i> and <i>parasiti</i> to act as
foils and butts for his wit. A satirical intention was frequently
present in both mimes and Atellanes, and their outspoken allusions
are more than once recorded to have wrung the withers of persons of
importance and to have brought serious retribution on the actors
themselves. Caligula, for instance, with characteristic brutality, had
a ribald playwright burnt alive in the amphitheatre<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>The farce was the diversion of the proletariat and the
<i>bourgeoisie</i> of Rome. Petronius, with all the insolence of the
literary man, makes Trimalchio buy a <i>troupe</i> of comedians, and
insist on their playing an Atellane<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The golden and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> cultured
classes preferred the pantomimic dance. This arose out of the ruins
of the literary drama. On the Roman stage grew up a custom, unknown
in Greece, by which the lyric portions of the text (<i>cantica</i>)
were entrusted to a singer who stood with the flute-player at the
side of the stage, while the actor confined himself to dancing in
silence with appropriate dumb show. The dialogue (<i>diverbia</i>)
continued to be spoken by the actors. The next step was to drop the
<i>diverbia</i> altogether; and thus came the <i>pantomimus</i> who
undertook to indicate the whole development of a plot in a series
of dramatic dances, during the course of which he often represented
several distinct <i>rôles</i>. Instead of the single flute-player and
singer a full choir now supplied the musical accompaniment, and great
poets—Lucan and Statius among the number—did not disdain to provide
texts for the <i>fabulae salticae</i>. Many of the <i>pantomimi</i>
attained to an extreme refinement in their degenerate and sensuous
art. They were, as Lucian said, χειρόσοφοι, erudite of gesture<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.
Their subjects were, for the most part, mythological and erotic, not
to say lascivious, in character<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Pylades the Cilician, who, with
his great rival Bathyllus the Alexandrian, brought the dance to its
first perfection under Augustus, favoured satyric themes; but this
mode does not appear to have endured. Practically the dancers were
the tragedians, and the mimes were the comedians, of the Empire. The
old Etruscan name for an actor, <i>histrio</i>, came to be almost
synonymous with <i>pantomimus</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Rome, which could lash itself
into a fury over the contests between the Whites and Reds or the
Blues and Greens in the circus, was not slow to take sides upon the
respective merits of its scenic entertainers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> <i>histrionalis
favor</i> led again and again to brawls which set the rulers of the
city wondering whether after all the <i>pantomimi</i> were worth while.
Augustus had found it to his advantage that the spirit of partisanship
should attach itself to a Pylades or a Bathyllus rather than to more
illustrious antagonists<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. But the personal instincts of Tiberius
were not so genial as those of Augustus. Early in his principate he
attempted to restrain the undignified court paid by senators and
knights to popular dancers, and when this measure failed, he expelled
the <i>histriones</i> from Italy<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. The example was followed by more
than one of his successors, but Rome clamoured fiercely for its toys,
and the period of exile was never a long one<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>Both <i>mimi</i> and <i>pantomimi</i> had their vogue in private, at
the banquets and weddings of the great, as well as in public. The
class of <i>scenici</i> further included a heterogeneous variety
of lesser performers. There were the rhapsodes who sung the tragic
<i>cantica</i>, torn from their context, upon the stage. There were
musicians and dancers of every order and from every land<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. There
were jugglers (<i>praestigiatores</i>, <i>acetabuli</i>), rope-walkers
(<i>funambuli</i>), stilt-walkers (<i>grallatores</i>), tumblers
(<i>cernui</i>, <i>petauristae</i>, <i>petaminarii</i>), buffoons
(<i>sanniones</i>, <i>scurrae</i>), beast-tamers and strong men. The
pick of them did their ‘turns’ in the theatre or the amphitheatre;
the more humble were content with modest audiences at street corners
or in the vestibule of the circus. From Rome the entertainers of the
imperial race naturally found their way into the theatres of the
provinces. Tragedy and comedy no doubt held their own longer in Greece,
but the stage of Constantinople under Justinian does not seem to have
differed notably from the stage of Rome under Nero. Marseilles alone
distinguished itself by the honourable austerity which forbade the
<i>mimi</i> its gates<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the profession of the <i>scenici</i>
ever became an honourable one in the eyes of the Roman law. They were
for the most part slaves or at best freedmen. They were deliberately
branded with <i>infamia</i> or incapacity for civil rights. This
<i>infamia</i> was of two kinds, depending respectively upon the action
of the censors as guardians of public dignity and that of the praetors
as presidents in the law courts. The censors habitually excluded actors
from the <i>ius suffragii</i> and the <i>ius honorum</i>, the rights
of voting and of holding senatorial or equestrian rank; the praetors
refused to allow them, if men, to appear as attorneys, if women, to
appoint attorneys, in civil suits<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. The legislation of Julius Caesar
and of Augustus added some statutory disabilities. The <i>lex Iulia
municipalis</i> forbade actors to hold municipal <i>honores</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>:
the <i>lex Iulia de adulteriis</i> set the example of denying them
the right to bring criminal actions<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; the <i>lex Iulia et Papia
Poppaea</i> limited their privileges when freed, and in particular
forbade senators or the sons of senators to take to wife women who
had been, or whose parents had been, on the stage<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. On the other
hand Augustus confined the <i>ius virgarum</i>, which the praetors
had formerly had over <i>scenici</i>, to the actual place and time
of performances<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; and so far as the censorian <i>infamia</i> was
concerned, the whole tendency of the late Republic and early Empire was
to relax its application to actors. It came to be possible for senators
and knights to appear on the stage without losing caste. It was a
grievous insult when Julius Caesar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> compelled the mimograph Laberius
to appear in one of his own pieces. But after all Caesar restored
Laberius to his rank of <i>eques</i>, a dignity which at a still
earlier date Sulla had bestowed on Roscius<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Later the restriction
broke down altogether, although not without an occasional reforming
effort to restore it<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. Nero himself was not ashamed to take the
boards as a singer of <i>cantica</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. And even an <i>infamis</i>,
if he were the boon companion of a prince, might be appointed to a
post directly depending on the imperial dignity. Thus Caracalla sent
a <i>pantomimus</i> to hold a military command on the frontier, and
Heliogabalus made another <i>praefectus urbi</i> in Rome itself<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.
Under Constantine a reaction set in, and a new decree formally excluded
<i>scenici</i> from all <i>dignitates</i><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. The severe class
legislation received only reluctant and piecemeal modification, and the
praetorian <i>infamia</i> outlived the Empire itself, and left its mark
upon Carolingian jurisprudence<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>The relaxation of the old Roman austerity implied in the popularity
of the <i>mimi</i> and <i>histriones</i> did not pass uncensured by
even the pagan moralists of the Empire. The stage has a share in the
denunciations of Tacitus and Juvenal, both of whom lament that princes
and patricians should condescend to practise arts once relegated to
the <i>infames</i>. Martial’s hypocrite rails at the times and the
theatres. Three centuries later the soldierly Ammianus Marcellinus
finds in the gyrations of the dancing-girls, three thousand of whom
were allowed to remain in Rome when it was starving, a blot upon the
fame of the state; and Macrobius contrasts the sober evenings of
Praetextatus and his friends with revels dependent for their mirth on
the song and wanton motions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> the <i>psaltria</i> or the jests of
<i>sabulo</i> and <i>planipes</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Policy compelled the emperors
to encourage <i>spectacula</i>, but even they were not always blind to
the ethical questions involved. Tiberius based his expulsion of the
<i>histriones</i>, at least in part, on moral grounds. Marcus Aurelius,
with a philosophic regret that the high lessons of comedy had sunk to
mere mimic dexterity, sat publicly in his box and averted his eyes to a
state-paper or a book<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Julian, weaned by his tutor Mardonius from
a boyish love of the stage, issued strict injunctions to the priests
of the Sun to avoid a theatre which he despaired of reforming<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
Christian teachers, unconcerned with the interests of a dynasty, and
claiming to represent a higher morality than that either of Marcus
Aurelius or of Julian, naturally took even stronger ground. Moreover,
they had their special reasons for hostility to the stage. That the
actors should mock at the pagan religion, with whose <i>ludi</i> their
own performances were intimately connected, made a good dialectical
point. But the connexion itself was unpardonable, and still more so
the part taken by the mimes during the war of creeds, in parodying
and holding up to ridicule the most sacred symbols and mysteries of
the church. This feeling is reflected in the legends of St. Genesius,
St. Pelagia and other holy folk, who are represented as turning from
the scenic profession to embrace Christianity, the conversion in some
cases taking place on the very boards of the theatre itself<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> So
far as the direct attack upon the stage is concerned, the key-note of
patristic eloquence is struck in the characteristic and uncompromising
treatise <i>De Spectaculis</i> of Tertullian. Here theatre, circus,
and amphitheatre are joined in a threefold condemnation. Tertullian
holds that the Christian has explicitly forsworn <i>spectacula</i>,
when he renounced the devil and all his works and vanities at baptism.
What are these but idolatry, and where is idolatry, if not in the
<i>spectacula</i>, which not only minister to lust, but take place at
the festivals and in the holy places of Venus and Bacchus? The story
is told of the demon who entered a woman in the theatre and excused
himself at exorcism, because he had found her in his own demesne.
A fervid exhortation follows. To worldly pleasures Christians have
no claim. If they need <i>spectacula</i> they can find them in the
exercises of their Church. Here are nobler poetry, sweeter voices,
maxims more sage, melodies more dulcet, than any comedy can boast, and
withal, here is truth instead of fiction. Moreover, for Christians
is reserved the last great <i>spectaculum</i> of all. ‘Then,’ says
Tertullian, ‘will be the time to listen to the tragedians, whose
lamentations will be more poignant for their proper pain. Then will
the comedians turn and twist, rendered nimbler than ever by the sting
of the fire that is not quenched<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.’ With Tertullian asceticism is
always a passion, but the vivid African rhetoric is no unfair sample
of a <i>catena</i> of outspoken comment which extends across the third
century from Tatian to Lactantius<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> The judgement of the Fathers
finds more cautious expression in the disciplinary regulations of
the Church. An early formal condemnation of actors is included in
the so-called <i>Canons</i> of Hippolytus<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, and the relations of
converts to the stage were discussed during the fourth century by
the councils of Elvira (306) and of Arles (314) and by the third and
fourth councils of Carthage (397-398)<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. It was hardly possible
for practical legislators to take the extreme step of forbidding
Christian laymen to enter the theatre at all. No doubt that would be
the counsel of perfection, but in dealing with a deep-seated popular
instinct something of a compromise was necessary<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. An absolute
prohibition was only established for the clergy: so far as the laity
were concerned, it was limited to Sundays and ecclesiastical festivals,
and on those days it was enforced by a threat of excommunication<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.
No Christian, however, might be a <i>scenicus</i> or a <i>scenica</i>,
or might marry one; and if a member of the unhallowed profession
sought to be baptized, the preliminary of abandoning his calling was
essential<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>It is curious to notice that a certain sympathy with the stage seems
to have been characteristic of one of the great heresiarchs. This was
none other than Arius, who is said to have had designs of setting up
a Christian theatre in rivalry to those of paganism, and his strange
work, the <i>Thaleia</i>, may perhaps have been intended to further
the scheme. At any rate an orthodox controversialist takes occasion to
brand his Arian opponents and their works as ‘thymelic’ or ‘stagy’<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
But it would probably be dangerous to lay undue stress upon what, after
all, is as likely as not to be merely a dialectical metaphor.</p>

<p>After the edict of Milan (313), and still more after the end of the
pagan reaction with the death of Julian (363), Christian influences
began to make themselves felt in the civil legislation of the Empire.
But if the councils themselves were chary of utterly forbidding the
theatre, a stronger line was not likely to be taken in rescripts from
Constantinople or Ravenna. The emperors were, indeed, in a difficult
position. They stood between bishops pleading for decency and humanity
and populaces now traditionally entitled to their <i>panem et
spectacula</i>. The theatrical legislation preserved in the <i>Code</i>
of Theodosius is not without traces of this embarrassment<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> is
rather an interesting study. The views of the Church were met upon two
points. One series of rescripts forbade performances on Sundays or
during the more sacred periods of the Christian calendar<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>: another
relaxed in favour of Christians the strict caste laws which sternly
forbade actresses or their daughters to quit the unhappy profession in
which they were born<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Moreover, certain sumptuary regulations were
passed, which must have proved a severe restriction on the popularity
as well as the liberty of actors. They were forbidden to wear gold
or rich fabrics, or to ape the dress of nuns. They must avoid the
company of Christian women and boys. They must not come into the public
places or walk the streets attended by slaves with folding chairs<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.
Some of the rescripts contain phrases pointed with the bitterest
contempt and detestation of their victims<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. Theodosius will not
have the portraits of <i>scenici</i> polluting the neighbourhood of
his own <i>imagines</i><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. It is made very clear that the old court
favourites are now to be merely tolerated. But they <i>are</i> to be
tolerated. The idea of suppressing them is never entertained. On the
contrary the provision of <i>spectacula</i> and of performers for them
remains one of the preoccupations of the government<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. The praetor
is expected to be lavish on this item of his budget<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> and special
municipal officers, the <i>tribuni voluptatum</i>, are appointed to
superintend the arrangements<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Private individuals and rival cities
must not deport actors, or withdraw them from the public service<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.
The bonds of caste, except for the few freed by their faith, are
drawn as tight as ever<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and when pagan worship ceases the shrines
are preserved from demolition for the sake of the theatres built
therein<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>The love of even professing Christians for <i>spectacula</i> proved
hard to combat. There are no documents which throw more light on the
society of the Eastern Empire at the close of the fourth century than
the works of St. Chrysostom; and to St. Chrysostom, both as a priest at
Antioch before 397 and as patriarch of Constantinople after that year,
the stage is as present a danger as it was to Tertullian two centuries
earlier<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. A sermon preached on Easter-day, 399, is good evidence of
this. St. Chrysostom had been attacking the stage for a whole year,
and his exhortations had just come to nought. Early in Holy Week there
was a great storm, and the people joined the rogatory processions. But
it was a week of <i>ludi</i>. On Good Friday the circus, and on Holy
Saturday the theatre, were thronged and the churches were empty. The
Easter sermon was an impassioned harangue, in which the preacher dwelt
once more on the inevitable corruption bound up with things theatrical,
and ended with a threat to enforce the sentence of excommunication,
prescribed only a few months before by the council of Carthage, upon
whoever should again venture to defy the Church’s law in like fashion
on Sunday or holy day<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. Perhaps one may trace the controversy
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> St. Chrysostom’s deliverance must have awakened, on the one
hand in the rescript of the autumn of 399 pointedly laying down that
the <i>ludicrae artes</i> must be maintained, on the other in the
prohibition of the following year against performances in Holy week,
and similar solemn tides.</p>

<p>More than a century after the exile and death of St. Chrysostom the
theatre was still receiving state recognition at Constantinople. A
regulation of Justinian as to the <i>ludi</i> to be given by newly
elected consuls specified a performance on the stage ominously
designated as the ‘Harlots’<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. By this date the <i>status</i> of the
theatrical profession had at last undergone further and noticeable
modification. The ancient Roman prohibition against the marriage of
men of noble birth with <i>scenicae</i> or other <i>infames</i> or the
daughters of such, had been re-enacted under Constantine. A partial
repeal in 454 had not extended to the <i>scenicae</i><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. During
the first half of the sixth century, however, a series of decrees
removed their disability on condition of their quitting the stage, and
further made it an offence to compel slaves or freed women to perform
against their will<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. In these humane relaxations of the rigid laws
of theatrical caste has often been traced the hand of the empress
Theodora, who, according to the contemporary gossip of Procopius, was
herself, before her conversion, one of the most shameless of mimes. But
it must be noted that the most important of the decrees in question
preceded the accession of Justinian, although it may possibly have been
intended to facilitate his own marriage<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The history of the stage
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> the East cannot be traced much further with any certainty. The
canons of the Quinisextine council, which met in the Trullan chamber
to codify ecclesiastical discipline in 692, appear to contemplate the
possibility of performances still being given<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. A modern Greek
scholar, M. Sathas, has made an ingenious attempt to establish the
existence of a Byzantine theatrical tradition right through the Middle
Ages; but Dr. Krumbacher, the most learned historian of Byzantine
literature, is against him, and holds that, so far as our knowledge
goes, the theatre must be considered to have perished during the stress
of the Saracen invasions which, in the seventh and eighth centuries,
devastated the East<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>The ending of the theatre in the West was in very similar fashion.
Chrysostom’s great Latin contemporaries, Augustine and Jerome, are at
one with him and with each other in their condemnation of the evils of
the public stage as they knew it<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Their divergent attitude on a
minor point may perhaps be explained by a difference of temperament.
The fifth century saw a marked revival of literary interests from
which even dignitaries of the Church did not hold themselves wholly
aloof. Ausonius urged his grandson to the study of Menander. Sidonius,
a bishop and no undevout one, read both Menander and Terence with
his son<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. With this movement Augustine had some sympathy. In a
well-known passage of the <i>Confessions</i> he records the powerful
influence exercised by tragedy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> and particularly erotic tragedy, over
his tempestuous youth<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. And in the <i>City of God</i> he draws a
careful distinction between the higher and the lower forms of drama,
and if he does not approve, at least does not condemn, the use of
tragedies and comedies in a humane education<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. Jerome, on the other
hand, although himself like Augustine a good scholar, takes a more
ascetic line, and a letter of his protesting against the reading of
comedies by priests ultimately came to be quoted as an authority in
Roman canon law<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p>The references to the stage in the works of two somewhat younger
ecclesiastical writers are of exceptional interest. Orosius was a
pupil of both Jerome and Augustine; and Orosius, endeavouring a few
years after the sack of Rome by the Goths to prove that that startling
disaster was not due to Christianity, lays great and indeed exaggerated
importance on the share of the theatre in promoting the decay of
the Empire<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. About the middle of the fifth century the same note
is struck by Salvian in his remarkable treatise <i>De Gubernatione
Dei</i><a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. The sixth book of his work is almost entirely devoted
to the <i>spectacula</i>. Like Tertullian, Salvian insists on the
definite renunciation of <i>spectacula</i> by Christians in their
baptismal vow<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. Like Orosius, he traces to the weakening of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> moral
fibre by these accursed amusements the failure of the West to resist
the barbarians. <i>Moritur et ridet</i> is his epigram on the Roman
world. The citizens of Tréves, three times destroyed, still called upon
their rulers for races and a theatre. With the Vandals at the very
gates of Cirta and of Carthage, <i>ecclesia Carthaginiensis insaniebat
in circis, luxuriebat in theatris</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Incidentally Salvian gives
some valuable information as to the survival of the stage in his day.
Already in 400 Augustine had been able to say that the theatres were
falling on every side<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. Salvian, fifty years later, confirms the
testimony, but he adds the reason. It was not because Christians had
learnt to be faithful to their vows and to the teachings of the Church;
but because the barbarians, who despised <i>spectacula</i>, and therein
set a good example to degenerate Romans<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, had sacked half the
cities, while in the rest the impoverished citizens could no longer pay
the bills. He adds that at Rome a circus was still open and a theatre
at Ravenna, and that these were thronged with delighted travellers from
all parts of the Empire<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. There must, however, have been a theatre
at Rome as well, for Sidonius found it there when he visited the city,
twelve years after it had been sacked for the second time, in 467. He
was appointed prefect of the city, and in one of his letters expresses
a fear lest, if the corn-supply fail, the thunders of the theatre
may burst upon his head<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. In a poem written a few years earlier
he describes the <i>spectacula theatri</i> of mimes, pantomimes, and
acrobats as still flourishing at Narbonne<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.</p>

<p>The next and the latest records of the stage in the West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> date from the
earlier part of the sixth century, when the Ostrogoths held sway in
Italy. They are to be found in the <i>Variae</i> of Cassiodorus, who
held important official posts under the new lords of Rome, and they
go to confirm the inference which the complaint of Salvian already
suggests that a greater menace to the continuance of the theatre lay in
the taste of the barbarians than even in the ethics of Christianity.</p>

<p>The Ostrogoths had long dwelt within the frontiers of the Empire, and
Theodoric, ruling as ‘King of the Goths and Romans in Italy,’ over a
mixed multitude of Italians and Italianate Germans, found it necessary
to continue the <i>spectacula</i>, which in his heart he despised.
There are many indications of this in the state-papers preserved
in the <i>Variae</i>, which may doubtless be taken to express the
policy and temper of the masters of Cassiodorus in the rhetorical
trappings of the secretary himself. The <i>scenici</i> are rarely
mentioned without a sneer, but their performances and those of the
<i>aurigae</i>, or circus-drivers, who have now come to be included
under the all-embracing designation of <i>histriones</i>, are carefully
regulated<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. The gladiators have, indeed, at last disappeared,
two centuries after Constantine had had the grace to suppress them
in the East<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. There is a letter from Theodoric to an architect,
requiring him to repair the theatre of Pompey, and digressing into an
historical sketch, imperfectly erudite, of the history of the drama,
its invention by the Greeks, and its degradation by the Romans<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.
A number of documents deal with the choice of a <i>pantomimus</i> to
represent the <i>prasini</i> or ‘Greens,’ and show that the rivalry
of the theatre-factions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> remained as fierce as it had been in the
days of Bathyllus and Pylades. Helladius is given the preference over
Thorodon, and a special proclamation exhorts the people to keep the
peace<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. Still more interesting is the <i>formula</i>, preserved
by Cassiodorus, which was used in the appointment of the <i>tribunus
voluptatum</i>, an official whom we have already come across in
the rescripts of the emperors of the fourth century. This is so
characteristic, in its contemptuous references to the nature of the
functions which it confers, of the whole German attitude in the matter
of <i>spectacula</i>, that it seems worth while to print it in an
appendix<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. The passages hitherto quoted from the <i>Variae</i> all
seem to belong to the period between 507 and 511, when Cassiodorus was
<i>quaestor</i> and secretary to Theodoric at Rome. A single letter
written about 533 in the reign of Athalaric shows that the populace was
still looking to its Gothic rulers for <i>spectacula</i>, and still
being gratified<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. Beyond this the Roman theatre has not been traced.
The Goths passed in 553, and Italy was reabsorbed in the Empire. In 568
came the Lombards, raw Germans who had been but little under southern
influence, and were far less ready than their predecessors to adopt
Roman manners. Rome and Ravenna alone remained as outposts of the older
civilization, the latter under an exarch appointed from Constantinople,
the former under its bishop. At Ravenna the theatre may conceivably
have endured; at Rome, the Rome of Gregory the Great, it assuredly did
not. An alleged mention of a theatre at Barcelona in Spain during the
seventh century resolves itself into either a survival of pagan ritual
or a bull-fight<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> Isidore of Seville has his learned chapters on
the stage, but they are written in the imperfect tense, as of what is
past and gone<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. The bishops and the barbarians had triumphed.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note</i> (for chs. ii-iv).—By far the best
account of minstrelsy is the section on <i>Les Propagateurs des
Chansons de Gestes</i> in vol. ii of L. Gautier, <i>Les Épopées
françaises</i> (2nd ed. 1892), bk. ii, chs. xvii-xxi. It may be
supplemented by the chapter devoted to the subject in J. Bédier,
<i>Les Fabliaux</i> (2nd ed. 1895), and by the dissertation of E.
Freymond, <i>Jongleurs und Menestrals</i> (Halle, 1883). I have
not seen A. Olrik, <i>Middelalderens vandrende Spillemænd</i>
(<i>Opuscula Philologica</i>, Copenhagen, 1887). Some German
facts are added by F. Vogt, <i>Leben und Dichten der deutschen
Spielleute im Mittelalter</i> (1876), and A. Schultz, <i>Das
höfische Leben zur Zeit der Minnesinger</i> (2nd ed. 1889),
i. 565, who gives further references. The English books are
not good, and probably the most reliable account of English
minstrelsy is that in the following pages; but materials may
be found in J. Strutt, <i>Sports and Pastimes of the People of
England</i> (1801, ed. W. Hone, 1830); T. Percy, <i>Reliques
of Ancient English Poetry</i> (ed. H. B. Wheatley, 1876,

Earliest Times to the Tudor Period</i> (1896); J. J. Jusserand,
<i>English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages</i> (trans. L.

by R. Merbot, <i>Aesthetische Studien zur angelsächsischen
Poesie</i> (1883), and F. M. Padelford, <i>Old English Musical
Terms</i> (1899). F. B. Gummere, <i>The Beginnings of Poetry</i>
(1901), should be consulted on the relations of minstrelsy to
communal poetry; and other special points are dealt with by O.
Hubatsch, <i>Die lateinischen Vagantenlieder des Mittelalters</i>
(1870); G. Maugras, <i>Les Comédiens hors la Loi</i> (1887),
and H. Lavoix, <i>La Musique au Siècle de Saint-Louis</i> (in

<p>The fall of the theatres by no means implied the complete extinction
of the <i>scenici</i>. They had outlived tragedy and comedy: they were
destined to outlive the stage itself. Private performances, especially
of <i>pantomimi</i> and other dancers, had enjoyed great popularity
under the Empire, and had become an invariable adjunct of all banquets
and other festivities. At such revels, as at the decadence of the
theatre and of public morals generally, the graver pagans had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> looked
askance<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>: the Church naturally included them in its universal
condemnation of <i>spectacula</i>. Chrysostom in the East<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, Jerome
in the West<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, are hostile to them, and a canon of the fourth-century
council of Laodicea, requiring the clergy who might be present at
weddings and similar rejoicings to rise and leave the room before
the actors were introduced, was adopted by council after council and
took its place as part of the ecclesiastical law<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. The permanence
of the regulation proves the strength of the habit, which indeed the
Church might ban, but was not able to subdue, and which seems to have
commended itself, far more than the theatre, to Teutonic manners.
Such irregular performances proved a refuge for the dispossessed
<i>scenici</i>. Driven from their theatres, they had still a vogue, not
only at banquets, but at popular merry-makings or wherever in street or
country they could gather together the remnant of their old audiences.
Adversity and change of masters modified many of their characteristics.
The <i>pantomimi</i>, in particular, fell upon evil times. Their
subtle art had had its origin in an exquisite if corrupt taste, and
adapted itself with difficulty to the ruder conditions of the new
civilizations<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. The <i>mimi</i> had always appealed to a common and
gross humanity. But even they must now rub shoulders and contend for
<i>denarii</i> with jugglers and with rope-dancers, with out-at-elbows
gladiators and beast-tamers. More than ever they learnt to turn their
hand to anything that might amuse; learnt to tumble, for instance;
learnt to tell the long stories which the Teutons loved. Nevertheless,
in essentials they remained the same; still jesters and buffoons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
still irrepressible, still obscene. In little companies of two or
three, they padded the hoof along the roads, travelling from gathering
to gathering, making their own welcome in castle or tavern, or, if need
were, sleeping in some grange or beneath a wayside hedge in the white
moonlight. They were, in fact, absorbed into that vast body of nomad
entertainers on whom so much of the gaiety of the Middle Ages depended.
They became <i>ioculatores</i>, <i>jongleurs</i>, minstrels<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<p>The features of the minstrels as we trace them obscurely from the sixth
to the eleventh century, and then more clearly from the eleventh to the
sixteenth, are very largely the features of the Roman <i>mimi</i> as
they go under, whelmed in the flood which bore away Latin civilization.
But to regard them as nothing else than <i>mimi</i> would be a serious
mistake. On another side they have a very different and a far more
reputable ancestry. Like other factors in mediaeval society, they
represent a merging of Latin and the Teutonic elements. They inherit
the tradition of the <i>mimus</i>: they inherit also the tradition of
the German <i>scôp</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. The earliest Teutonic poetry, so far as can
be gathered, knew no <i>scôp</i>. As will be shown in a later chapter,
it was communal in character, closely bound up with the festal dance,
or with the rhythmic movements of labour. It was genuine folk-song, the
utterance of no select caste of singers, but of whoever in the ring of
worshippers or workers had the impulse and the gift to link the common
movements to articulate words. At the festivals such a spokesman would
be he who, for whatever reason, took the lead in the ceremonial rites,
the <i>vates</i>, germ at once of priest and bard. The subject-matter
of communal song was naturally determined by the interests ruling on
the occasions when it was made. That of daily life would turn largely
on the activities of labour itself: that of the high days on the
emotions of religion, feasting, and love which were evoked by the
primitive revels of a pastoral or agricultural folk.</p>

<p>Presently the movements of the populations of Europe brought the
Germanic tribes, after separating from their Scandinavian kinsmen,
into contact with Kelts, with Huns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> with the Roman Empire, and, in
the inevitable recoil, with each other. Then for the first time war
assumed a prerogative place in their life. To war, the old habits
and the old poetry adapted themselves. Tiwaz, once primarily the god
of beneficent heaven, became the god of battles. The chant of prayer
before the onset, the chant of triumph and thanksgiving after the
victory, made themselves heard<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. From these were disengaged, as a
distinct species of poetry, songs in praise of the deeds and deaths
of great captains and popular heroes. Tacitus tells us that poetry
served the Germans of his day for both chronology and history<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.
Jordanis, four centuries later, has a similar account to give of the
Ostrogoths<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. Arminius, the vanquisher of a Roman army, became the
subject of heroic songs<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>: Athalaric has no higher word of praise
for Gensimund than <i>cantabilis</i><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. The glories of Alboin the
Lombard<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, of Charlemagne himself<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, found celebration in verse,
and Charlemagne was at the pains to collect and record the still
earlier <i>cantilenae</i> which were the chronicle of his race. Such
historical <i>cantilenae</i>, mingled with more primitive ones of
mythological import, form the basis of the great legendary epics<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.
But the process of epic-making is one of self-conscious and deliberate
art, and implies a considerable advance from primitive modes of
literary composition. No doubt the earliest heroic <i>cantilenae</i>
were still communal in character. They were <i>rondes</i> footed
and sung at festivals by bands of young men and maidens. Nor was
such folk-song quick to disappear. Still in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> eleventh century
the deeds of St. William of Orange resounded amongst the <i>chori
iuvenum</i><a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; and spinning-room and village green were destined
to hear similar strains for many centuries more<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. But long before
this the <i>cantilenae</i> had entered upon another and more productive
course of development: they were in the mouths, not only of the folk,
but also of a body of professional singers, the fashioners of the epic
that was to be<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. Like heroic song itself, the professional singers
owed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> their origin to war, and to the prominence of the individual, the
hero, which war entailed. Around the person of a great leader gathered
his individual following or <i>comitatus</i>, bound to him by ties of
mutual loyalty, by interchange of service and reward<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. Amongst
the <i>comitatus</i> room was found for one who was no spearman, but
who, none the less honoured for that, became the poet of the group and
took over from the less gifted <i>chorus</i> the duty of celebrating
the praises of the chieftain. These he sung to the accompaniment, no
longer of flying feet, but of the harp, struck when the meal was over
in tent or hall. Such a harper is the characteristically Germanic type
of professional entertainer. He has his affinities with the Demodokos
of a Homeric king. Rich in dignities and guerdons, sitting at the foot
of the leader, consorting on equal terms with the warriors, he differs
wholly from the <i>scenicus infamis</i>, who was the plaything and
the scorn of Rome. Precisely when the shifting of social conditions
brought him into being it is hard to say. Tacitus does not mention
him, which is no proof, but a presumption, that amongst the tribes on
the frontier he had not yet made his appearance in the first century
of the Empire. By the fifth century he was thoroughly established, and
the earliest records point to his existence at least as early as the
fourth. These are not to be found in Latin sources, but in those early
English poems which, although probably written in their extant forms
after the invasion of these islands, seem to date back in substance to
the age when the Angles still dwelt in a continental home around the
base of the Jutish peninsula. The English remained to a comparatively
late stage of their history remote from Roman influence, and it is in
their literature that both the original development of the Teutonic
<i>scôp</i> and his subsequent contamination by the Roman <i>mimus</i>
can most easily be studied.</p>

<p>The earliest of all English poems is almost certainly <i>Widsith</i>,
the ‘far-traveller.’ This has been edited and interpolated in Christian
England, but the kernel of it is heathen and continental<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. It is
an autobiographic sketch of the life of Widsith, who was himself an
actual or ideal <i>scôp</i>, or rather <i>gleómon</i>, for the precise
term <i>scôp</i> is not used in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> poem. Widsith was of the Myrgings,
a small folk who dwelt hard by the Angles. In his youth he went
with Ealhhild, the ‘weaver of peace,’ on a mission to Eormanric the
Ostrogoth. Eormanric is the Hermanric of legend, and his death in 375
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> gives an approximate date to the events narrated. Then
Widsith became a wanderer upon the face of the earth, one who could
‘sing and say a story’ in the ‘mead-hall.’ He describes the nations
and rulers he has known. Eormanric gave him a collar of beaten gold,
and Guthhere the Burgundian a ring. He has been with Caesar, lord of
jocund cities, and has seen Franks and Lombards, Finns and Huns, Picts
and Scots, Hebrews, Indians, Egyptians, Medes and Persians. At the
last he has returned to the land of the Myrgings, and with his fellow
Scilling has sung loud to the harp the praises of his lord Eadgils and
of Ealhhild the daughter of Eadwine. Eadgils has given him land, the
inheritance of his fathers. The poem concludes with an eulogy of the
life of gleemen. They wander through realm upon realm, voice their
needs, and have but to give thanks. In every land they find a lord to
whom songs are dear, and whose bounty is open to the exalters of his
name. Of less undeniable antiquity than <i>Widsith</i> are the lines
known as the <i>Complaint of Deor</i>. These touch the seamy side of
the singer’s life. Deor has been the <i>scôp</i> of the Heodenings many
winters through. But one more skilled, Heorrenda by name—the Horant
of the Gudrun saga—has outdone him in song, and has been granted the
land-right that once was Deor’s. He finds his consolation in the woes
of the heroes of old. ‘They have endured: may not I endure<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>?’ The
outline drawn in <i>Widsith</i> and in <i>Deor</i> is completed by
various passages in the epic of <i>Beowulf</i>, which may be taken
as representing the social conditions of the sixth or early seventh
century. In Heorot, the hall of Hrothgar, there was sound of harp,
the gleewood. Sweetly sang the <i>scôp</i> after the mead-bench. The
lay was sung, the gleeman’s <i>gyd</i> told. Hrothgar’s thanes, even
Hrothgar himself, took their turns to unfold the wondrous tale. On the
other hand, when a folk is in sorrow, no harp is heard, the glee-beam
is silent in the halls<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. In these three poems, then, is fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
limned the singer of Teutonic heathenism. He is a man of repute, the
equal of thanes. He holds land, even the land of his fathers. He
receives gifts of gold from princes for the praise he does them. As
yet no distinction appears between <i>scôp</i> and <i>gleómon</i>.
Widsith is at one time the resident singer of a court; at another, as
the mood takes him, a wanderer to the ends of the earth. And though
the <i>scôp</i> leads the song, the warriors and the king himself do
not disdain to take part in it. This is noteworthy, because it gives
the real measure of the difference between the Teutonic and the Roman
entertainer. For a Nero to perform amongst the <i>scenici</i> was
to descend: for a Hrothgar to touch the harp was a customary and an
honourable act.</p>

<p>The singing did not cease when the English came to these islands. The
long struggle with the Britons which succeeded the invasions assuredly
gave rise to many new lays, both in Northumbria and Wessex. ‘England,’
says Mr. Stopford Brooke, ‘was conquered to the music of verse, and
settled to the sound of the harp.’ But though Alfred and Dunstan knew
such songs, they are nearly all lost, or only dimly discerned as the
basis of chronicles. At the end of the sixth century, just as the
conquest was completed, came Christianity. The natural development of
English poetry was to some extent deflected. A religious literature
grew up at the hands of priests. Eadhelm, who, anticipating a notion
of St. Francis of Assisi, used to stand on a bridge as if he were a
gleeman, and waylay the folk as they hurried back from mass, himself
wrote pious songs. One of these, a <i>carmen triviale</i>, was still
sung in the twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. This was in Wessex. In Northumbria,
always the most literary district of early England, the lay brother
Cædmon founded a school of divine poetry. But even amongst the
disciples of Cædmon, some, such as the author of the very martial
<i>Judith</i>, seem to have designed their work for the mead-hall as
well as the monastery<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. And the regular <i>scôp</i> by no means
vanished. The <i>Wanderer</i>, a semi-heathen elegiac poem of the early
eighth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> century, seems to be the lament of a <i>scôp</i> driven from
his haunts, not by Christianity, but by the tumults of the day<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.
The great poet of the next generation, Cynewulf, himself took treasure
of appled gold in the mead-hall. A riddle on ‘the wandering singer’
is ascribed to him<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, and various poems of his school on the fates
or the crafts of man bear witness to the continued existence of the
class<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. With the eighth century, except for the songs of war quoted
or paraphrased in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, the extant Early
English poetry reaches a somewhat inexplicable end. But history comes
to the rescue, and enables us still to trace the <i>scôp</i>. It is
in the guise of a harp-player that Alfred is reported to have fooled
the Danes, and Anlaf in his turn to have fooled the Saxons<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>:
and mythical as these stories may be, they would not have even been
plausible, had not the presence of such folk by the camp-fire been a
natural and common event.</p>

<p>Certainly the <i>scôp</i> survived heathenism, and many Christian
bishops and pious laymen, such as Alfred<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>, were not ashamed of
their sympathy with secular song. Nevertheless, the entertainers of
the English folk did not find favour in the eyes of the Church as a
whole. The stricter ecclesiastics especially attacked the practice
of harbouring them in religious houses. Decrees condemning this were
made by the council on English affairs which sat at Rome in 679<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>,
and by the council of Clovesho in 747<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Bede, writing at about
the latter date on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> condition of church affairs in Northumbria
complains of those who make mirth in the dwellings of bishops<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>;
and the complaint is curiously illustrated by a letter of Gutbercht,
abbot of Newcastle, to an episcopal friend on the continent, in
which he asks him for a <i>citharista</i> competent to play upon the
<i>cithara</i> or <i>rotta</i> which he already possesses<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. At the
end of the eighth century, Alcuin wrote a letter to Higbald, bishop
of Lindisfarne, warning him against the snares of <i>citharistae</i>
and <i>histriones</i><a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>: and some two hundred years later, when
Edgar and Dunstan<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> were setting themselves to reform the religious
communities of the land, the favour shown to such ribald folk was one
of the abuses which called for correction<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. This hostile attitude
of the rulers of the Church is not quite explained by anything in the
poetry of the <i>scôpas</i>, so far as it is left to us. This had very
readily exchanged its pagan for a Christian colouring: it cannot be
fairly accused of immorality or even coarseness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> the Christian
sentiment of the time is not likely to have been much offended by
the prevailing theme of battle and deeds of blood. The probable
explanation is a double one. There is the ascetic tendency to regard
even harmless forms of secular amusement as barely compatible with
the religious life. And there is the fact, which the language of the
prohibitions themselves makes plain, that a degeneration of the old
Teutonic gleemen had set in. To singing and harping were now added
novel and far less desirable arts. Certainly the prohibitions make no
exception for <i>poetae</i> and <i>musici</i>; but the full strength
of their condemnation seems to be directed against <i>scurrae</i> and
their <i>ioca</i>, and against the <i>mimi</i> and <i>histriones</i>
who danced as well as sang. These are new figures in English life,
and they point to the fact that the merging of the Teutonic with the
Latin entertainer had begun. To some extent, the Church itself was
responsible for this. The conversion of England opened the remote
islands to Latin civilization in general: and it is not to be wondered
at, that the <i>mimi</i>, no less than the priests, flocked into the
new fields of enterprise. If this was the case already in the eighth
century, we can hardly doubt that it was still more so during the next
two hundred years of which the literary records are so scanty. Such a
view is supported by the numerous miniatures of dancers and tumblers,
jugglers and bear-leaders, in both Latin and Early English manuscripts
of this period<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, and by the glosses which translate such terms
as <i>mimus</i>, <i>iocista</i>, <i>scurra</i>, <i>pantomimus</i>
by <i>gligmon</i>, reserving <i>scôp</i> for the dignified
<i>poeta</i><a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> This distinction I regard as quite a late one,
consequent upon the degeneracy introduced by <i>mimi</i> from south
Europe into the lower ranks of the gleemen. Some writers, indeed, think
that it existed from the beginning, and that the <i>scôp</i> was always
the resident court poet, whereas the <i>gleómon</i> was the wandering
singer, often a borrower rather than a maker of songs, who appealed to
the smaller folk<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. But the theory is inconsistent with the data
of <i>Widsith</i>. The poet there described is sometimes a wanderer,
sometimes stationary. He is evidently at the height of his profession,
and has sung before every crowned head in Europe, but he calls himself
a <i>gleómon</i>. Nor does the etymology of the words <i>scôp</i> and
<i>gleómon</i> suggest any vital difference of signification<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>The literary records of the continental Teutons are far scantier
than those of the English. But amongst them also Latin and barbaric
traditions seem to have merged in the <i>ioculator</i>. Ancestral
deeds were sung to the harp, and therefore, it may be supposed, by a
<i>scôp</i>, and not a <i>chorus</i>, before the Ostrogoths in Italy,
at the beginning of the sixth century<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. In the year 507 Clovis
the Frank sent to Theodoric for a <i>citharoedus</i> trained in the
musical science of the South, and Boethius was commissioned to make
the selection<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. On the other hand, little as the barbarians loved
the theatre, the <i>mimi</i> and <i>scurrae</i> of the conquered lands
seem to have tickled their fancy as they sat over their wine. At the
banquet with which Attila entertained the imperial ambassadors in
448, the guests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> were first moved to martial ardour and to tears by
the recital of ancient deeds of prowess, and then stirred to laughter
by the antics of a Scythian and a Moorish buffoon<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. Attila was
a Hun and no German; but the Vandals who invaded Africa in 429 are
recorded to have taken to the <i>spectacula</i> so extravagantly
popular there<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and Sidonius tells how <i>mimici sales</i>,
chastened in view of barbaric conceptions of decency, found a place
in the festivities of another Theodoric, king from 462 to 466 of the
Visigoths in Gaul<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. Three centuries later, under Charlemagne, the
blending of both types of entertainer under the common designation of
<i>ioculator</i> seems to be complete. And, as in contemporary England,
the animosity of the Church to the <i>scenici</i> is transferred
wholesale to the <i>ioculatores</i>, without much formal attempt to
discriminate between the different grades of the profession. Alcuin
may perhaps be taken as representing the position of the more rigid
disciplinarians on this point. His letter to the English bishop,
Higbald, does not stand alone. In several others he warns his pupils
against the dangers lurking in <i>ludi</i> and <i>spectacula</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>,
and he shows himself particularly exercised by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> the favour which they
found with Angilbert, the literary and far from strict-lived abbot
of St. Richer<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. The influence of Alcuin with Charlemagne was
considerable, and so far as ecclesiastical rule went, he had his way.
A capitulary (†787) excluded the Italian clergy from uncanonical
sports<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. In 789 bishops, abbots, and abbesses were forbidden to
keep <i>ioculatores</i><a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, and in 802 a decree applying to all in
orders required abstinence from idle and secular amusements<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.
These prohibitions were confirmed in the last year of Charlemagne’s
reign (813) by the council of Tours<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. But as entertainers of the
lay folk, the minstrels rather gained than lost status at the hands
of Charlemagne. Personally he took a distinct interest in their
performances. He treasured up the heroic <i>cantilenae</i> of his
race<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, and attempted in vain to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> inspire the <i>saevitia</i> of his
sons with his own enthusiasm for these<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. The chroniclers more than
once relate how his policy was shaped or modified by the chance words
of a <i>ioculator</i> or <i>scurra</i><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. The later tradition of
the <i>jougleurs</i> looked back to him as the great patron of their
order, who had given them all the fair land of Provence in fee<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>:
and it is clear that the songs written at his court form the basis not
only of the <i>chansons de gestes</i>, but also, as we found to be the
case with the English war-songs, of many passages in the chronicles
themselves<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. After Charlemagne’s death the minstrels fell for a
time on evil days. Louis the Pious by no means shared his father’s love
for them. He attempted to suppress the <i>cantilenae</i> on which he
had been brought up, and when the <i>mimi</i> jested at court would
turn away his head and refuse to smile<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. To his reign may perhaps
be ascribed a decree contained in the somewhat dubious collection of
Benedictus Levita, forbidding idle dances, songs and tales in public
places and at crossways on Sundays<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, and another which continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
for the benefit of the minstrels the legal incapacity of the Roman
<i>scenici</i>, and excluded <i>histriones</i> and <i>scurrae</i> from
all privilege of pleading in courts of justice<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.</p>

<p>The ill-will of a Louis the Pious could hardly affect the hold which
the minstrels had established on society. For good or for bad, they
were part of the mediaeval order of things. But their popularity
had to maintain itself against an undying ecclesiastical prejudice.
They had succeeded irrevocably to the heritage of hate handed down
from the <i>scenici infames</i>. To be present at their performances
was a sin in a clerk, and merely tolerated in a layman. Largesse to
them was declared tantamount to robbery of the poor<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. It may be
fairly said that until the eleventh century at least the history of
minstrelsy is written in the attacks of ecclesiastical legislators,
and in the exultant notices of monkish chroniclers when this or that
monarch was austere enough to follow the example of Louis the Pious,
and let the men of sin go empty away<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. Throughout the Middle
Ages proper the same standpoint was officially maintained<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.
The canon law, as codified by Gratian, treats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> as applicable to
minstrels the pronouncements of fathers and councils against the
<i>scenici</i>, and adds to them others more recent, in which clergy
who attend <i>spectacula</i>, or in any way by word or deed play the
<i>ioculator</i>, are uncompromisingly condemned<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. This temper
of the Church did not fail to find its expression in post-Conquest
England. The council of Oxford in 1222 adopted for this country
the restatement of the traditional rule by the Lateran council of
1215<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>; and the stricter disciplinary authorities at least attempted
to enforce the decision. Bishop Grosseteste of Lincoln, for instance,
pressed it upon his clergy in or about 1238<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. The reforming
provisions of Oxford in 1259 laid down that, although minstrels might
receive charitable doles in monasteries, their <i>spectacula</i>
must not be given<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>; and a similar prohibition, couched in very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
uncomplimentary terms, finds a place in the new statutes drawn up in
1319 for the cathedral church of Sarum by Roger de Mortival<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. A
few years later the statutes of St. Albans follow suit<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>, while in
1312 a charge of breaking the canons in this respect brought against
the minor clergy of Ripon minster had formed the subject of an inquiry
by Archbishop Greenfield<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. Such notices might be multiplied<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>;
and the tenor of them is echoed in the treatises of the more
strait-laced amongst monkish writers. John of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, William
Fitz Stephen<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, Robert Mannyng of Brunne<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, are at one in their
disapproval of <i>ioculatores</i>. As the fourteenth century draws to
its close, and the Wyclifite spirit gets abroad, the freer critics of
church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> and state, such as William Langland<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> or the imagined author
of Chaucer’s <i>Parson’s Tale</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, take up the same argument. And
they in their turn hand it on to the interminable pamphleteering of the
Calvinistic Puritans<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<span class="small">THE MINSTREL LIFE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The perpetual <i>infamia</i> of the minstrels is variously reflected
in the literature of their production. Sometimes they take their
condemnation lightly enough, dismissing it with a jest or a touch of
bravado. In <i>Aucassin et Nicolete</i>, that marvellous romance of
the <i>viel caitif</i>, when the hero is warned that if he takes a
mistress he must go to hell, he replies that, to hell will he go, for
thither go all the goodly things of the world. ‘Thither go the gold
and the silver, and the vair and the grey, and thither too go harpers
and minstrels and the kings of the world. With these will I go, so
that I have Nicolete, my most sweet friend, with me’<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. At other
times they show a wistful sense of the pathos of their secular lot.
They tell little stories in which heaven proves more merciful than
the vice-gerents of heaven upon earth, and Virgin or saint bestows
upon a minstrel the sign of grace which the priest denies<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>. But
often, again, they turn upon their persecutors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> and rend them with
the merciless satire of the <i>fabliaux</i>, wherein it is the clerk,
the theologian, who is eternally called upon to play the indecent or
ridiculous part<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p>Under spiritual disabilities the minstrels may have been, but so far
as substantial popularity amongst all classes went, they had no cause
from the eleventh to the fourteenth century to envy the monks. As a
social and literary force they figure largely both on the continent
and in England. The distinctively Anglo-Saxon types of <i>scôp</i>
and <i>gleómon</i> of course disappear at the Conquest. They do not
cease to exist; but they go under ground, singing their defiant lays
of Hereward<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>; and they pursue a more or less subterranean career
until the fourteenth century brings the English tongue to its own
again. But minstrelsy was no less popular with the invaders than with
the invaded. Whether the <i>skald</i> had yet developed amongst the
Scandinavian pirates who landed with Rollo on the coasts of France
may perhaps be left undetermined<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>: for a century and a half
had sufficed to turn the Northmen into Norman French, and with the
other elements of the borrowed civilization had certainly come the
<i>ioculator</i>. In the very van of William’s army at Senlac strutted
the minstrel Taillefer, and went to his death exercising the double
arts of his hybrid profession, juggling with his sword, and chanting
an heroic lay of Roncesvalles<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. Twenty years later, Domesday
Book records how Berdic the <i>ioculator regis</i> held three vills
and five carucates of land in Gloucestershire, and how in Hampshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Adelinda, a <i>ioculatrix</i>, held a virgate, which Earl Roger had
given her<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. During the reigns of the Angevin and Plantagenet
kings the minstrels were ubiquitous. They wandered at their will from
castle to castle, and in time from borough to borough, sure of their
ready welcome alike in the village tavern, the guildhall, and the
baron’s keep<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. They sang and jested in the market-places, stopping
cunningly at a critical moment in the performance, to gather their
harvest of small coin from the bystanders<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. In the great castles,
while lords and ladies supped or sat around the fire, it was theirs
to while away many a long bookless evening with courtly <i>geste</i>
or witty sally. At wedding or betrothal, baptism or knight-dubbing,
treaty or tournament, their presence was indispensable. The greater
festivities saw them literally in their hundreds<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>, and rich was
their reward in money and in jewels, in costly garments<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>, and in
broad acres. They were licensed vagabonds, with free right of entry
into the presence-chambers of the land<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. You might know them from
afar by their coats of many colours, gaudier than any knight might
respectably wear<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>, by the instruments upon their backs and those
of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> servants, and by the shaven faces, close-clipped hair and
flat shoes proper to their profession<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. This kenspeckle appearance,
together with the privilege of easy access, made the minstrel’s dress
a favourite disguise in ages when disguise was often imperative. The
device attributed by the chroniclers to Alfred and to Anlaf becomes
in the romances one of the commonest of <i>clichés</i><a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. The
readiness with which the minstrels won the popular ear made them a
power in the land. William de Longchamp, the little-loved chancellor
of Richard I, found it worth his while to bring a number of them over
from France, that they might sing his praises abroad in the public
places<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. Nor were they less in request for satire than for eulogy.
The English speaking minstrels, in particular, were responsible for
many songs in derision of unpopular causes and personalities<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>; and
we need not doubt that ‘the lay that Sir Dinadan made by King Mark,
which was the worst lay that ever harper sang with harp or with any
other instruments,’ must have had its precise counterparts in actual
life<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>. The Sarum statutes of 1319 lay especial stress on the
flattery and the evil speaking with which the minstrels rewarded their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
entertainers<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. Sometimes, indeed, they over-reached themselves, for
Henry I is related to have put out the eyes of Lucas de Barre, a Norman
<i>jougleur</i>, or perhaps rather <i>trouvère</i>, who made and sang
songs against him<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. But Lucas de Barre’s rank probably aggravated
his offence, and as a rule the minstrels went scot-free. A wiser
churchman here and there was not slow to perceive how the unexampled
hold of minstrelsy on the popular ear might be turned to the service of
religion. Eadhelm, standing in gleeman’s attire on an English bridge
to mingle words of serious wisdom with his <i>carmina trivialia</i>,
is one instance<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. And in the same spirit St. Francis, himself
half a troubadour in youth, would call his Minorites <i>ioculatores
Domini</i>, and send them singing over the world to beg for their fee
the repentance and spiritual joy of their hearers<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. A popular
hymn-writer of the present day is alleged to have thought it ‘hard that
the devil should have all the good tunes’; but already in the Middle
Ages religious words were being set to secular music, and graced with
the secular imagery of youth and spring<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p>But if the minstrels were on the one hand a force among the people,
on the other they had the ear of kings. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> English court to judge
by the payments recorded in the exchequer books, must have been full
of them<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. The fullest and most curious document on the subject
dates from the reign of Edward I. It is a roll of payments made on
the occasion of a Whitsuntide feast held in London in the year 1306,
and a very large number of the minstrels recorded are mentioned by
name<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. At the head of the list come five minstrels with the
high-sounding title of <i>le roy</i><a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>, and these get five marks
apiece. A number of others follow, who received sums varying from one
mark upwards. Most of these have French names, and many are said to be
in the company of this or that noble or reverend guest at the feast.
Finally, two hundred marks were distributed in smaller sums amongst the
inferior minstrels, <i>les autres menestraus de la commune</i>, and
some of these seem to have been of English birth. Below the <i>roys</i>
rank two minstrels, Adam le Boscu and another, who are dignified with
the title of <i>maistre</i>, which probably signifies that they were
clerks<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. The other names are mainly descriptive, ‘Janin le Lutour,’
‘Gillotin le Sautreour,’ ‘Baudec le Taboureur,’ and the like; a few
are jesting stage names, such as the inferior performers of our music
halls bear to-day<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. Such are ‘Guillaume sanz Maniere,’ ‘Reginaldus
le Menteur,’ ‘le Petit Gauteron,’ ‘Parvus Willielmus,’ and those of the
attractive comedians Perle in the Eghe, and Matill’ Makejoye. The last,
by the way, is the only woman performer named. The resources of Edward
I could no doubt stand the strain of rewarding with royal magnificence
the entertainers of his guests. There is plenty of evidence, however,
that even on secular grounds the diatribes of the moralists against
the minstrels were often enough justified. To the lavish and unthrifty
of purse they became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> blood-suckers. Matilda, the wife of Henry I, is
said to have squandered most of her revenues upon them<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>; while the
unfortunate Robert of Normandy, if no less a chronicler than Ordericus
Vitalis may be believed, was stripped by these rapacious gentry to the
very skin<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. Yet for all the days of honour and all the rich gifts
the minstrel life must have had its darker side. Easily won, easily
parted with; and the lands and laced mantles did not last long, when
the elbow itched for the dice-box. This was the incurable ruin of the
minstrel folk<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. And even that life of the road, so alluring to the
fever in the blood, must have been a hard one in the rigours of an
English climate. To tramp long miles in wind and rain, to stand wet
to the skin and hungry and footsore, making the slow <i>bourgeois</i>
laugh while the heart was bitter within; such must have been the daily
fate of many amongst the humbler minstrels at least<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. And at the
end to die like a dog in a ditch, under the ban of the Church and with
the prospect of eternal damnation before the soul.</p>

<p>Kings and nobles were not accustomed to depend for their entertainment
merely upon the stray visits of wandering minstrels. Others more or
less domiciled formed a permanent part of the household. These indeed
are the minstrels in the stricter sense of that term—<i>ministri</i>,
<i>ministeriales</i>. In Domesday Book, as we have seen, one Berdic
bears the title of the <i>ioculator regis</i>. Shortly afterwards
Henry I had his <i>mimus regis</i>, by name Raherus, who made large
sums by his <i>suavitas iocularis</i>, and founded the great priory of
St. Bartholomew at Smithfield<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. Laying aside his parti-coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
coat, he even became himself the first prior of the new community.
The old spirit remained with him, however; and it is recorded that
the fame of the house was largely magnified by means of some feigned
miracles which Raherus put forth. Richard I was a noted lover of song,
and the names of more than one minstrel of his are preserved. There
was Ambroise, who was present at Richard’s coronation in 1189 and at
the siege of Acre in 1191, and who wrote a history, still extant, of
the third crusade<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. And there was that Blondiaux or Blondel de
Nesle, the story of whose discovery of his captive master, apocryphal
though it may be, is in all the history books<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>. Henry III had
his <i>magister Henricus versificator</i> in 1251<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>, and his
<i>magister Ricardus citharista</i> in 1252<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. A harper was also
amongst the <i>ministri</i> of Prince Edward in the Holy War<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>,
and when the prince became Edward I, he still retained one in his
service. He is mentioned as Walter de Stourton, the king’s harper, in
1290<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>, and as the <i>citharista regis</i> in 1300<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. Edward
II had several minstrels, to one of whom, William de Morlee, known
as <i>Roy de North</i>, he made a grant of land<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. By this time
the royal minstrels seem to have become a regular establishment of no
inconsiderable numbers. Under Edward III they received 7¹⁄₂<i>d.</i>
a day<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. A little later in the reign, between 1344 and 1347,
there were nineteen who received 12<i>d.</i> a day in war, when
they doubtless formed a military band, and 20<i>s.</i> a year in
peace. These included five trumpeters, one citoler, five pipers, one
tabouretter, two clarions, one nakerer, and one fiddler, together with
three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> additional minstrels, known as waits<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>. The leader of the
minstrels bore the title of <i>rex</i>, for in 1387 we find a licence
given by Richard II to his <i>rex ministrallorum</i>, John Caumz,
permitting him to pass the seas<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. Henry V had fifteen minstrels
when he invaded France in 1415, and at a later date eighteen, who
received 12<i>d.</i> a day apiece<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. At the end of his reign his
minstrels received 100<i>s.</i> a year, and this annuity was continued
under Henry VI, who in 1455 had twelve of them, besides a wait. In the
next year this king issued a commission for the impressing of boys to
fill vacancies in the body<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. Edward IV had thirteen minstrels and a
wait<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. By 1469 these had been cut down to eight. At their head was
a chief, who was now called, not as in Richard II’s time <i>rex</i>,
but <i>marescallus</i><a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. The eight king’s minstrels and their
<i>marescallus</i> can be traced through the reign of Henry VII, and so
on into the sixteenth century<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor was the royal household singular in the maintenance of a permanent
body of minstrels. The <i>citharista</i> of Margaret, queen of Edward
I, is mentioned in 1300, and her <i>istrio</i> in 1302<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. Philippa,
queen of Edward III, had her minstrels in 1337<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, and those of Queen
Elizabeth were a regular establishment in the reign of Henry VII<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.
The Scottish court, too, had its recognized troupe, known by the early
years of the sixteenth century as the ‘minstrels of the chekkar<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.’
As with kings and queens so with lesser men. The list of minstrels
at court in 1306 includes the harpers and other musicians of several
lords, both English and foreign<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>. In 1308 the earl of Lancaster had
a body of <i>menestralli</i> and an <i>armiger menestrallorum</i><a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.
During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries entries of payments
to the minstrels of a vast number of <i>domini</i>, small and great,
are common in the account books<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. Henry, earl of Derby, took
minstrels with him in his expeditions abroad of 1390 and 1392<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>;
while the <i>Household Book</i> of the earl of Northumberland (†1512)
shows that he was accustomed to entertain ‘a Taberett, a Luyte, and a
Rebecc,’ as well as six ‘trompettes<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.’ Minstrels are also found,
from the beginning of the fifteenth century, in the service of the
municipal corporations. London, Coventry, Bristol, Shrewsbury, Norwich,
Chester, York, Beverley, Leicester, Lynn, Canterbury had them, to name
no others. They received fixed fees or dues, wore the town livery and
badge of a silver scutcheon, played at all local celebrations and
festivities, and were commonly known as <i>waits</i><a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. This term
we have already found in use at court, and the ‘Black Book,’ which
contains the household regulations of Edward IV, informs us that the
primary duty of a wait was to ‘pipe the watch,’ summer and winter, at
certain fixed hours of the night<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that established minstrels, whether royal,
noble, or municipal, were always in constant attendance on their lords.
Certain fixed services were required of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> which were not very
serious, except in the case of waits<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>; for the rest of their time
they were free. This same ‘Black Book’ of Edward IV is very explicit on
the point. The minstrels are to receive a yearly fee and a livery<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.
They must attend at court for the five great feasts of the year. At
other times, two or three out of their number, or more if the king
desire it, are to be in waiting. The last regulation on the subject
is curious. The king forbids his minstrels to be too presumptuous or
familiar in asking rewards of any lord of the land; and in support of
this he quotes a similar prohibition by the Emperor Henry II<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.
Doubtless, in the intervals of their services, the household minstrels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
travelled, like their unattached brethren of the road, but with the
added advantage of a letter of recommendation from their lord, which
ensured them the hospitality of his friends<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. Such letters were
indeed often given, both to the minstrels of a man’s own household and
as testimonials to other minstrels who may have especially pleased the
giver. Those interesting collections of mediaeval epistolary formulae,
the <i>summae dictaminis</i>, contain many models for them, and judging
by the lavish eulogy which they employ, the minstrels themselves must
have had a hand in drawing them up<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. Many minstrels probably
confined themselves to short tours in the vicinity of their head
quarters; others, like Widsith, the Anglo-Saxon <i>scôp</i>, were far
travellers. John Caumz received a licence from Richard II to cross the
seas, and in 1483 we find Richard III entertaining minstrels of the
dukes of Austria and Bavaria<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. Possibly the object of John Caumz
was to visit one of the <i>scolae ministrallorum</i> in France, where
experiences might be exchanged and new songs learnt. Beauvais, Lyon,
Cambrai were famous for these schools, which were held year by year
in Lent, when performances were stopped; and the wardrobe accounts of
Edward III record grants of licences and expenses to Barbor and Morlan,
two bagpipers, to visit the <i>scolas ministrallis in partibus trans
mare</i><a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>From the fourteenth century it is possible to trace the growth of the
household minstrels as a privileged class at the expense of their less
fortunate rivals. The freedom of access enjoyed by the entertainers of
earlier days was obviously open to abuse. We have seen that in 1317
it led to the offering of an insult to Edward II by an emissary clad
as a minstrel at his own table. It was only two years before that a
royal proclamation had considerably restrained the liberty of the
minstrels. In view of the number of idle persons who ‘under colour of
mynstrelsie’ claimed food, drink, and gifts in private houses, it was
ordered ‘that to the houses of prelates earls and barons none resort
to meate and drynke, unless he be a mynstrel, and of these mynstrels
that there come none except it be three or four minstrels of honour
at the most in one day, unlesse he be desired of the lorde of the
house.’ The houses of meaner men are to be altogether exempt, except
at their desire<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. I think it is probable that by ‘minstrels of
honour’ we must here understand ‘household minstrels<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>’; and that
the severity of the ordinance must have come upon those irresponsible
vagrants who had not the shelter of a great man’s name. With the
Statutes of Labourers in the middle of the fourteenth century begins a
history of legislation against ‘vacabonds and valiant beggars,’ which
put further and serious difficulties in the way of the free movement
of the migratory classes through the country<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. Minstrels, indeed,
are not specifically declared to be ‘vacabonds’ until this legislation
was codified by William Cecil in 1572<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>; but there is evidence that
they were none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> the less liable to be treated as such, unless they had
some protection in the shape of livery or licence. At Chester from the
early thirteenth century, and at Tutbury in Staffordshire from 1380,
there existed courts of minstrelsy which claimed to issue licences
to all performers within their purview. It is not probable that this
jurisdiction was very effective. But a step taken by Edward IV in 1469
had for its avowed object to strengthen the hands of what may be called
official minstrelsy. Representation had been made to the king that
certain rude husbandmen and artificers had usurped the title and livery
of his minstrels, and had thus been enabled to gather an illegitimate
harvest of fees. He therefore created or revived a regular guild or
fraternity of minstrels, putting his own household performers with
their <i>marescallus</i> at the head of it, and giving its officers
a disciplinary authority over the profession throughout the country,
with the exception of Chester. It is not improbable, although it is
not distinctly stated, that admission into the guild was practically
confined to ‘minstrels of honour.’ Certainly one of the later local
guilds which grew up in the sixteenth century, that of Beverley,
limited its membership to such as could claim to be ‘mynstrell to some
man of honour or worship or waite of some towne corporate or other
ancient town, or else of such honestye and conyng as shalbe thought
laudable and pleasant to the hearers<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.’ In any case the whole drift
of social development was to make things difficult for the independent
minstrels and to restrict the area of their wanderings.</p>

<p>The widespread popularity of the minstrels amongst the mediaeval laity,
whether courtiers, burghers, or peasants, needs no further labouring.
It is more curious to find that in spite of the formal anathemas of the
Church upon their art, they were not, as a matter of fact, rigorously
held at arm’s length by the clergy. We find them taking a prominent
part in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> holyday festivities of religious guilds<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>; we find
them solacing the slow progress of the pilgrimages with their ready
wit and copious narrative or song<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>; we find them received with
favour by bishops, even upon their visitations<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, and not excluded
from a welcome in the hall of many a monastery. As early as 1180, one
Galfridus, a <i>citharoedus</i>, held a ‘corrody,’ or right to a daily
commons of food and drink in the abbey of Hyde at Winchester<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.
And payments for performances are frequent in the accounts of the
Augustinian priories at Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, Bicester, and Maxtoke, and
the great Benedictine houses of Durham, Norwich, Thetford, and St.
Swithin’s, Winchester<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, and doubtless in those of many another
cloistered retreat. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> Minorite chroniclers relate, how at the time
of the coming of the friars in 1224 two of them were mistaken for
minstrels by the porter of a Benedictine grange near Abingdon, received
by the prior and brethren with unbecoming glee, and when the error was
discovered, turned out with contumely<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>. At such semi-religious
foundations also, as the college of St. Mary at Winchester, or
Waynflete’s great house of St. Mary Magdalen in Oxford, minstrels of
all degrees found, at least by the fifteenth century, ready and liberal
entertainment<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>How, then, is one to reconcile this discrepancy between the actual
practice of the monasteries and the strict, the uncompromising
prohibition of minstrelsy in rule and canon? An incomplete answer
readily presents itself. The monks being merely human, fell short of
the ideal prescribed for them. We do not now learn for the first time,
that the ambitions of the pious founder, the ecclesiastical law-giver,
the patristic preacher, were one thing; the effective daily life of
churchmen in many respects quite another. Here, as in matters of even
more moment, did mediaeval monasticism ‘dream from deed dissever’—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By-cause that it was old and som-del streit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And held after the newe world the space.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>True enough, but not the whole truth. It doubtless explains the
behaviour of the Benedictines of Abingdon; but we can hardly suppose
that when Robert de Grosseteste, the sworn enemy of ecclesiastical
abuses, kept his harper’s chamber next his own, he was surreptitiously
allowing himself an illegitimate gratification which he denied
to his clergy. The fact is that the condemnations of the Church,
transferred, as we have seen, wholesale from the <i>mimi</i> and
<i>histriones</i> of the decaying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> Empire, were honestly not applicable
without qualification, even from the ecclesiastical point of view, to
their successors, the <i>mimi</i> and <i>histriones</i> of the Middle
Ages. The traditions of the Roman stage, its manners, its topics, its
ethical code, became indeed a large part of the direct inheritance of
minstrelsy. But, as we have seen, they were far from being the whole
of that inheritance. The Teutonic as well as the Latin element in the
civilization of western Europe must be taken into account. The minstrel
derives from the disreputable <i>planipes</i>; he derives also from
the <i>scôp</i>, and has not altogether renounced the very different
social and ethical position which the <i>scôp</i> enjoyed. After all,
nine-tenths of the secular music and literature, something even of the
religious literature, of the Middle Ages had its origin in minstrelsy.
Practically, if not theoretically, the Church had to look facts in
the face, and to draw a distinction between the different elements
and tendencies that bore a single name. The formularies, of course,
continued to confound all minstrels under the common condemnation of
<i>ioculatores</i>. The Church has never been good at altering its
formularies to suit altered conditions. But it has generally been good
at practical compromises. And in the case of minstrelsy, a practical
compromise, rough enough, was easily arrived at.</p>

<p>The effective conscience of the thirteenth-century Church had clearly
come to recognize degrees in the ethical status of the minstrels.
No more authoritative exponent of the official morals of his day
can be desired than St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Thomas Aquinas is
very far from pronouncing an unqualified condemnation of all secular
entertainment. The profession of an <i>histrio</i>, he declares, is by
no means in itself unlawful. It was ordained for the reasonable solace
of humanity, and the <i>histrio</i> who exercises it at a fitting time
and in a fitting manner is not on that account to be regarded as a
sinner<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. Another contemporary document is still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span> explicit.
This is the <i>Penitential</i> written at the close of the thirteenth
century by Thomas de Cabham, sub-dean of Salisbury and subsequently
archbishop of Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. In the course of his analysis of human
frailty, Thomas de Cabham makes a careful classification from the
ethical point of view, of minstrels. There are those who wear horrible
masks, or entertain by indecent dance and gesture. There are those
again who follow the courts of the great, and amuse by satire and
by raillery. Both these classes are altogether damnable. Those that
remain are distinguished by their use of musical instruments. Some
sing wanton songs at banquets. These too are damnable, no less than
the satirists and posture-mongers. Others, however, sing of the deeds
of princes, and the lives of the saints. To these it is that the name
<i>ioculatores</i> more strictly belongs, and they, on no less an
authority than that of Pope Alexander himself<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>, may be tolerated.</p>

<p>Of the three main groups of minstrels distinguished by Thomas de
Cabham, two correspond roughly to the two broad types which, from the
point of view of racial tradition, we have already differentiated. His
musicians correspond to the Teutonic gleemen and their successors;
his posture-mongers and buffoons to the Roman <i>mimi</i> and their
successors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> Who then are Thomas de Cabham’s third and intermediate
group, the satirists whose lampoons beset the courts of the great?
Well, raillery and invective, as we have seen, were common features of
minstrelsy; but Gautier may very likely be right when he surmises that
Thomas de Cabham has particularly in mind the <i>scolares vagantes</i>,
who brought so much scandal upon the Church during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. Some of these were actually out at elbows
and disfrocked clerks; others were scholars drifting from university
to university, and making their living meantime by their wits; most
of them were probably at least in minor orders. But practically they
lived the life of the minstrels, tramping the road with them, sharing
the same temptations of wine, women, and dice, and bringing into the
profession a trained facility of composition, and at least a flavour
of classical learning<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. They were indeed the main intermediaries
between the learned and the vernacular letters of their day; the spilth
of their wit and wisdom is to be found in the burlesque Latin verse of
such collections as the <i>Carmina Burana</i>, riotous lines, by no
means devoid of poetry, with their half-humorous half-pathetic burden,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘In taberna quando sumus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Non curamus quid sit humus<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And especially they were satirists, satirists mainly of the hypocrisy,
cupidity and evil living of those in the high places of the Church,
for whom they conceived a grotesque expression in Bishop Golias, a
type of materialistic prelate, in whose name they wrote and whose
<i>pueri</i> or <i>discipuli</i> they declared themselves to be<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.
<i>Goliardi</i>, <i>goliardenses</i>, their reputation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> the
eyes of the ecclesiastical authorities was of the worst, and their
ill practices are coupled with those of the minstrels in many a
condemnatory decree<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not with the <i>goliardi</i> then, that Thomas de Cabham’s
relaxation of the strict ecclesiastical rigours is concerned. Neither
is it, naturally enough, with the lower minstrels of the <i>mimus</i>
tradition. Towards these Thomas de Cabham, like his predecessors,
is inexorable. And even of the higher minstrels the musicians and
singers, his toleration has its limits. He discriminates. In a
sense, a social and professional sense, all these higher minstrels
fall into the same class. But from the ethical point of view there
is a very marked distinction amongst them. Some there are who haunt
taverns and merry-makings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> with loose songs of love and dalliance.
These it is not to be expected that the holy mother Church should
in any way countenance. Her toleration must be reserved for those
more reputable performers who find material for their verse either
in the life and conversation of the saints and martyrs themselves,
or at least in the noble and inspiring deeds of national heroes and
champions. Legends of the saints and gests of princes: if the minstrels
will confine themselves to the celebration of these, then, secure
in the pronouncement of a pope, they may claim a hearing even from
the devout. It would be rash to assert that even the comparatively
liberal theory of Thomas de Cabham certainly justified in all cases
the practice of the monasteries. But it is at least noteworthy that
in several instances where the subjects of the minstrelsy presented
for the delectation of a cowled audience remain upon record, they do
fall precisely within the twofold definition which he lays down. At
Winchester in 1338 the minstrel Herbert sang the song of Colbrond (or
Guy of Warwick), and the gest of the miraculous deliverance of Queen
Emma; while at Bicester in 1432 it was the legend of the Seven Sleepers
of Ephesus that made the Epiphany entertainment of the assembled canons.</p>

<p>If now we set aside the very special class of ribald <i>galiardi</i>,
and if we set aside also the distinction drawn by Thomas de Cabham on
purely ethical grounds between the minstrels of the love-songs and the
minstrels of saintly or heroic gest, the net result is the twofold
classification of higher and lower minstrels already familiar to us.
Roughly—it must always be borne in mind how roughly—it corresponds
on the one hand to the difference between the Teutonic and the Roman
tradition, on the other to the distinction between the established
‘minstrel of honour’ and his unattached rival of the road. And there
is abundant evidence that such a distinction was generally present,
and occasionally became acute, in the consciousness of the minstrels
themselves. The aristocrats of minstrelsy, a Baudouin or a Jean de
Condé, or a Watriquet de Couvin, have very exalted ideas as to the
dignity of their profession. They will not let you, if they can help
it, put the <i>grans menestreus</i> on the same level with every-day
<i>jangleur</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> of poor attainments and still poorer repute<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.
In the <i>Dit des Taboureurs</i> again it is a whole class, the
<i>joueurs de vielle</i>, who arise to vindicate their dignity and to
pour scorn upon the humble and uninstructed drummers<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. But the
most instructive and curious evidence comes from Provence. It was in
1273, when the amazing growth of Provençal poetry was approaching
its sudden decay, that the last of the great troubadours, Guiraut de
Riquier, addressed a verse <i>Supplicatio</i> to Alphonso X of Castile
on the state of minstrelsy. He points out the confusion caused by
the indiscriminate grouping of poets, singers, and entertainers of
all degrees under the title of <i>joglars</i>, and begs the king, as
high patron of letters, to take order for it. A reply from Alphonso,
also in verse, and also, one may suspect, due to the fertile pen
of Guiraut Riquier, is extant. Herein he establishes or confirms a
fourfold hierarchy. At the head come two classes, the <i>doctors de
trobar</i> and the <i>trobaires</i>, who are composers, the former of
didactic, the latter of ordinary songs and melodies. Beneath these are
the <i>joglars</i> proper, instrumentalists and reciters of delightful
stories, and beneath these again the <i>bufos</i>, the entertainers
of common folk, who have really no claim to be considered as
<i>joglars</i> at all<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. One of the distinctions here made is new to
us. The difference between <i>doctor de trobar</i> and <i>trobaire</i>
is perhaps negligible. But that between the <i>trobaire</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span> or
composer and the <i>joglar</i> or executant of poetry, is an important
one. It is not, however, so far as the Teutonic element in minstrelsy
goes, primitive. The <i>scôpas</i> and the French or Anglo-Norman
<i>ioculatores</i> up to the twelfth century composed their verses as a
class, and sang them as well<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>. In Provence, however, the Teutonic
element in minstrelsy must have been of the slightest, and perhaps the
Roman tradition, illustrated by the story of Laberius, of a marked
barrier between composing and executing, had vaguely lingered. At any
rate it is in Provence, in the eleventh century, that the distinction
between <i>trobaire</i> and <i>joglar</i> makes its appearance. It
never became a very complete one. The <i>trobaire</i> was generally,
not always, of gentle or burgess birth; sometimes actually a king
or noble. In the latter case he contented himself with writing his
songs, and let the <i>joglars</i> spread them abroad. But the bulk of
the <i>trobaires</i> lived by their art. They wandered from castle
to castle, alone with a <i>vielle</i>, or with <i>joglars</i> in
their train, and although they mingled with their hosts on fairly
equal terms, they did not disdain to take their rewards of horse
or mantle or jewel, just like any common performer. Moreover, they
confined themselves to lyric poetry, leaving the writing of epic, so
far as epic was abroad in Provence, to the <i>joglars</i><a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>. From
Provence, the <i>trobaire</i> spread to other countries, reappearing
in the north of France and England as the <i>trouvère</i>. We seem to
trace an early <i>trouvère</i> in Lucas de Barre in the time of Henry
I. But it is Eleanor of Poitiers, daughter of the <i>trobaire</i>
count William of Poitiers, and mother of the <i>trouvère</i> Richard
Cœur de Lion, who appears as the chief intermediary between north and
south. The intrusion of the <i>trouvère</i> was the first step in the
degradation of minstrelsy. Amongst the Anglo-Saxons, even apart from
the <i>cantilenae</i> of the folk, the professional singer had no
monopoly of song. Hrothgar and Alfred harped with their <i>scôpas</i>.
But if there had been a similar tendency amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span> continental
Teutons who merged in the French and Norman-French, it had been checked
by the complete absorption of all literary energies, outside the
minstrel class, in neo-Latin. It was not until the twelfth century,
and as has been said, under Provençal influence, that secular-minded
clerks, and exceptionally educated nobles, merchants, or officials,
began to devote themselves to the vernacular, and by so doing to
develop the <i>trouvère</i> type. The <i>trouvère</i> had the advantage
of the minstrel in learning and independence, if not in leisure; and
though the latter long held his own by the side of his rival, he was
fated in the end to give way, and to content himself with the humbler
task of spreading abroad what the <i>trouvère</i> wrote<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. By the
second quarter of the fourteenth century, the conquest of literature by
the <i>bourgeoisie</i> was complete. The interest had shifted from the
minstrel on the hall floor to the burgher or clerk in the <i>puy</i>;
the prize of a successful poem was no longer a royal mantle, but a
laureate crown or the golden violet of the <i>jeux floraux</i>; and
its destiny less to be recited at the banquet, than read in the bower.
In England the completion of the process perhaps came a little later,
and was coincident with the triumph of English, the tongue of the
<i>bourgeois</i>, over French, the tongue of the noble. The full flower
of minstrelsy had been the out-at-elbows vagabond, Rutebeuf. The full
flower of the <i>trouvère</i> is the comptroller of the customs and
subsidies of the port of London, Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>

<p>The first distinction, then, made by Guiraut Riquier, that between
<i>trobaire</i> and <i>joglar</i>, implies a development from within
minstrelsy itself that was destined one day to overwhelm it. But
the second, that between the <i>joglar</i> and the <i>bufo</i>, is
precisely the one already familiar to us, between the minstrels of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> <i>scôp</i> and the minstrels of the <i>mimus</i> tradition.
And, as has been said, it is partly, if not entirely, identical with
that which grew up in course of time between the protected minstrels
of the court and of great men’s houses, and their vagrant brethren
of the road. This general antithesis between the higher and lower
mintrelsy may now, perhaps, be regarded as established. It was the
neglect of it, surely, that led to that curious and barren logomachy
between Percy and Ritson, in which neither of the disputants can be
said to have had hold of more than a bare half of the truth<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>. And
it runs through the whole history of minstrelsy. It became acute, no
doubt, with the growth in importance of the minstrels of honour in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But it had probably been just as
acute, if not more so, at the very beginning of things, when the clash
of Teutonic and Roman civilization first brought the bard face to face
with the serious rivalry of the mime. Bard and mime merged without ever
becoming quite identical; and even at the moment when this process was
most nearly complete, say in the eleventh century, the <i>jouglerie
seigneuriale</i>, to use Magnin’s happy terms, was never quite the
same thing as the <i>jouglerie foraine et populaire</i><a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>, least
of all in a country like England where differences of tongue went to
perpetuate and emphasize the breach.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the antithesis may easily be pushed too far. After
all, the minstrels were entertainers, and therefore their business
was to entertain. Did the lord yawn over a gest or a saintly legend?
the discreet minstrel would be well advised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> drop high art, and
to substitute some less exacting, even if less refined fashion of
passing the time. The instincts of boor and baron were not then, of
course, so far apart as they are nowadays. And as a matter of fact
we find many of the most eminent minstrels boasting of the width
and variety of their accomplishments. Thus of Baudouin II, count of
Guisnes (1169-1206), it is recorded that he might have matched the most
celebrated professionals, not only in <i>chansons de gestes</i> and
<i>romans d’aventure</i> but also in the <i>fabliaux</i> which formed
the delight of the vulgar <i>bourgeoisie</i><a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. Less aristocratic
performers descended even lower than Baudouin de Guisnes. If we study
the répertoires of such <i>jougleurs</i> as the diabolic one in Gautier
de Coincy’s miracle<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>, or Daurel in the romance of <i>Daurel
et Beton</i><a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>, or the disputants who vaunt their respective
proficiencies in <i>Des Deus Bordeors Ribauz</i><a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>, we shall find
that they cover not only every conceivable form of minstrel literature
proper, but also tricks with knives and strings, sleight of hand,
dancing and tumbling. Even in Provence, the <i>Enseignamens</i> for
<i>joglars</i> warn their readers to learn the arts of imitating birds,
throwing knives, leaping through hoops, showing off performing asses
and dogs, and dangling marionettes<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. So that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> one discerns the
difference between the lower and the higher minstrels to have been not
so much that the one did not sink so low, as that the other, for lack
of capacity and education, did not rise so high.</p>

<p>The palmy days of minstrelsy were the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. The germ of decay, however, which appeared when the
separation grew up between <i>trouvère</i> and <i>jougleur</i>, and
when men began to read books instead of listening to recitations, was
further developed by the invention of printing. For then, while the
<i>trouvère</i> could adapt himself readily enough to the new order
of things, the <i>jougleur’s</i> occupation was gone. Like Benedick
he might still be talking, but nobody marked him. Eyes cast down over
a page of Chaucer or of Caxton had no further glitter or tear for him
to win<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>. The fifteenth, and still more the sixteenth century,
witness the complete break-up of minstrelsy in its mediaeval form. The
mimes of course endured. They survived the overthrow of mediaevalism,
as they had survived the overthrow of the Empire<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. The Tudor
kings and nobles had still their jugglers, their bearwards, their
domestic buffoons, jesters or fools<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>. Bearbaiting in Elizabethan
London rivalled the drama in its vogue. Acrobats and miscellaneous
entertainers never ceased to crowd to every fair, and there is
applause even to-day in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> circus and music-hall for the old jests and
the old somersaults that have already done duty for upwards of twenty
centuries. But the <i>jougleur</i> as the thirteenth century knew him
was by the sixteenth century no more. Professional musicians there
were in plenty; ‘Sneak’s noise’ haunted the taverns of Eastcheap<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>,
and instrumentalists and vocalists in royal palaces and noble mansions
still kept the name and style of minstrels. But they were not minstrels
in the old sense, for with the production of literature, except
perhaps for a song here and there, they had no longer anything to
do. That had passed into other hands, and even the lineaments of the
<i>trouvère</i> are barely recognizable in the new types of poets
and men of letters whom the Renaissance produced. The old fashioned
minstrel in his style and habit as he lived, was to be presented before
Elizabeth at Kenilworth as an interesting anachronism<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>. Some of the
discarded entertainers, as we shall see, were absorbed into the growing
profession of stage-players; others sunk to be ballad singers. For to
the illiterate the story-teller still continued to appeal. The ballad
indeed, at least on one side of it, was the <i>detritus</i>, as the
<i>lai</i> had been the germ, of romance<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, and at the very moment
when Spenser was reviving romance as a conscious archaism, it was still
possible for a blind fiddler with a ballad to offend the irritable
susceptibilities of a Puritan, or to touch the sensitive heart-strings
of a Sidney<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. But as a social and literary force, the glory of
minstrelsy had departed<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.</p>

<span class="small">THE MINSTREL REPERTORY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The floor of a mediaeval court, thronged with minstrels of every
degree, provided at least as various an entertainment as the Roman
stage itself<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. The performances of the mimes, to the accompaniment
of their despised tabor or wry-necked fife, undoubtedly made up
in versatility for what they lacked in decorum. There were the
<i>tombeors</i>, <i>tombesteres</i> or <i>tumbleres</i>, acrobats and
contortionists, who twisted themselves into incredible attitudes, leapt
through hoops, turned somersaults, walked on their heads, balanced
themselves in perilous positions. Female tumblers, <i>tornatrices</i>,
took part in these feats, and several districts had their own
characteristic modes of tumbling, such as <i>le tour français</i>,
<i>le tour romain</i>, <i>le tour de Champenois</i><a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. Amongst
the <i>tombeors</i> must be reckoned the rarer <i>funambuli</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> or
rope-walkers, such as he whom the Corvei annals record to have met
with a sorry accident in the twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, or he who created
such a <i>furore</i> in the thirteenth by his aerial descent from
the cathedral at Basle<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>. Nor are they very distinct from the
crowd of dancers, male and female, who are variously designated as
<i>saltatores</i> and <i>saltatrices</i>, ‘sautours,’ ‘sailyours,’
‘hoppesteres.’ Indeed, in many mediaeval miniatures, the daughter of
Herodias, dancing before Herod, is represented rather as tumbling
or standing on her head than in any more subtle pose<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>. A second
group includes the jugglers in the narrower sense, the <i>jouers des
costeax</i> who tossed and caught knives and balls<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>, and the
practitioners of sleight of hand, who generally claimed to proceed
by <i>nigremance</i> or sorcery<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. The two seem to have shared
the names of <i>prestigiatores</i> or <i>tregetours</i><a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. Other
mimes, the <i>bastaxi</i>, or <i>jouers des basteax</i>, brought round,
like the Punch and Judy men of our own day, little wooden performing
puppets or marionettes<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>. Others, to whom Thomas de Cabham more
particularly refers, came in masked as animals, and played the dog, the
ass or the bird with appropriate noises and behaviour<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> Others,
again, led round real animals; generally bears or apes, occasionally
also horses, cocks, hares, dogs, camels and even lions<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>. Sometimes
these beasts did tricks; too often they were baited<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>, and from
time to time a man, lineal descendant of the imperial gladiators,
would step forward to fight with them<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. To the gladiatorial shows
may perhaps also be traced the fight with wooden swords which often
formed a part of the fun<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. And, finally, whatever the staple of
the performance, there was the <i>parade</i> or preliminary patter to
call the audience together, and throughout the ‘carping,’ a continuous
flow of rough witticism and repartee, such as one is accustomed to
hear Joey, the clown, in the pauses of a circus, pass off on Mr.
Harris, the ring-master<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. Here came in the especial talents of the
<i>scurra</i>, <i>bordeor</i> or <i>japere</i>, to whom the moralists
took such marked exception. ‘<i>L’uns fet l’ivre, l’autre le sot</i>’
says the <i>fabliau</i>; and indeed we do not need the testimony
of Thomas de Cabham or of John of Salisbury to conclude that such
buffoonery was likely to be of a ribald type<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>.</p>

<p>Even in the high places of minstrelsy there was some measure of
variety. A glance at the pay-sheet of Edward I’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> Whitsuntide feast
will show that the minstrels who aspired to be musicians were
habitually distinguished by the name of the musical instrument on
which they played. They are <i>vidulatores</i>, <i>citharistae</i>,
<i>trumpatores</i>, <i>vilours</i>, <i>gigours</i>, <i>crouderes</i>,
<i>harpours</i>, <i>citolers</i>, <i>lutours</i>, <i>trumpours</i>,
<i>taboreurs</i> and the like. The harp (<i>cithara</i>), played by
twitching the strings, had been the old instrument of the Teutons, but
in the Middle Ages it came second in popularity to the <i>vielle</i>
(<i>vidula</i>), which was also a string instrument, but, like the
modern fiddle, was played with a bow. The drum (<i>tympanum</i>,
<i>tabour</i>) was, as we have seen, somewhat despised, and relegated
to the mimes. The trumpeters appear less often singly than in twos
and threes, and it is possible that their performances may have been
mainly ceremonial and of a purely instrumental order. But the use of
music otherwise than to accompany the voice does not seem to have gone,
before the end of the thirteenth century, much beyond the signals,
flourishes and fanfares required for wars, triumphs and processions.
Concerted instrumental music was a later development<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>. The ordinary
function of the harp or <i>vielle</i> in minstrelsy was to assist the
voice of the minstrel in one of the many forms of poetry which the
middle ages knew. These were both lyric and narrative. The distinction
is roughly parallel to that made by Thomas de Cabham when he subdivides
his highest grades of minstrels into those who sing wanton songs at
taverns, and those more properly called <i>ioculatores</i> who solace
the hearts of men with reciting the deeds of the heroes and the lives
of the saints. The themes of mediaeval lyric, as of all lyric, are
largely wantonness and wine; but it must be borne in mind that Thomas
de Cabham’s classification is primarily an ethical one, and does
not necessarily imply any marked difference of professional status
between the two classes. The haunters of taverns and the solacers of
the virtuous were after all the same minstrels, or at least minstrels
of the same order. That the <i>chansons</i>, in their innumerable
varieties, caught up from folk-song, or devised by Provençal ingenuity,
were largely in the mouths of the minstrels, may be taken for granted.
It was here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> however, that the competition of <i>trobaire</i> and
<i>trouvère</i> began earliest, and proved most triumphant, and the
supreme minstrel <i>genre</i> was undoubtedly the narrative. This
was, in a sense, their creation, and in it they held their own, until
the laity learned to read and the <i>trouvères</i> became able to
eke out the shortness of their memories by writing down or printing
their stories. With narrative, no doubt, the minstrels of highest
repute mainly occupied themselves. Harp or <i>vielle</i> in hand they
beguiled many a long hour for knight and <i>châtelaine</i> with the
interminable <i>chansons de gestes</i> in honour of Charlemagne and
his heroic band<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>, or, when the vogue of these waned, as in time it
did, with the less primitive <i>romans d’aventure</i>, of which those
that clustered round the Keltic Arthur were the widest famed. Even so
their repertory was not exhausted. They had <i>lais</i>, <i>dits</i>
and <i>contes</i> of every kind; the devout <i>contes</i> that Thomas
de Cabham loved, historical <i>contes</i>, romantic <i>contes</i> of
less alarming proportions than the genuine <i>romans</i>. And for the
<i>bourgeoisie</i> they had those improper, witty <i>fabliaux</i>, so
racy of the French soil, in which the <i>esprit gaulois</i>, as we
know it, found its first and not its least characteristic expression.
In most of these types the music of the instrument bore its part. The
shorter <i>lais</i> were often accompanied musically throughout<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.
The longer poems were delivered in a chant or recitative, the monotony
of which was broken at intervals by a phrase or two of intercalated
melody, while during the rest of the performance a few perfunctory
notes served to sustain the voice<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>. And at times, especially in
the later days of minstrelsy, the harp or <i>vielle</i> was laid
aside altogether, and the singer became a mere story-teller. The
antithesis, no infrequent one, between minstrel, and <i>fabulator</i>,
<i>narrator</i>, <i>fableor</i>, <i>conteor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> estour</i>,
<i>disour</i>, <i>segger</i>, though all these are themselves
elsewhere classed as minstrels, sufficiently suggests this<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. It
was principally, one may surmise, the <i>dits</i> and <i>fabliaux</i>
that lent themselves to unmusical narration; and when prose crept in,
as in time it did, even before reading became universal, it can hardly
have been sung. An interesting example is afforded by <i>Aucassin et
Nicolete</i>, which is what is known as a <i>cantefable</i>. That is
to say, it is written in alternate sections of verse and prose. The
former have, in the Paris manuscript, a musical accompaniment, and are
introduced with the words ‘<i>Or se cante</i>’; the latter have no
music, and the introduction ‘<i>Or content et dient et fablent</i>.’</p>

<p>A further differentiation amongst minstrels was of linguistic origin.
This was especially apparent in England. The mime is essentially
cosmopolitan. In whatever land he finds himself the few sentences of
patter needful to introduce his <i>tour</i> or his <i>nigremance</i>
are readily picked up. It is not so with any entertainer whose
performances claim to rank, however humbly, as literature. And the
Conquest in England brought into existence a class of minstrels who,
though they were by no means mimes, were yet obliged to compete with
mimes, making their appeal solely to the <i>bourgeoisie</i> and the
peasants, because their speech was not that of the Anglo-Norman lords
and ladies who formed the more profitable audiences of the castles.
The native English gleemen were eclipsed at courts by the Taillefers
and Raheres of the invading host. But they still held the road side
by side with their rivals, shorn of their dignities, and winning a
precarious livelihood from the shrunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> purses of those of their own
blood and tongue<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>. It was they who sang the unavailing heroisms
of Hereward, and, if we may judge by the scanty fragments and records
that have come down to us, they remained for long the natural focus and
mouthpiece of popular discontent and anti-court sentiment. In the reign
of Edward III a gleeman of this type, Laurence Minot, comes to the
front, voicing the spirit of an England united in its nationalism by
the war against France; the rest are, for the most part, nameless<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.
Naturally the English gleemen did not remain for ever a proscribed and
isolated folk. One may suspect that at the outset many of them became
bilingual. At any rate they learnt to mingle with their Anglo-Norman
<i>confrères</i>: they borrowed the themes of continental minstrelsy;
translating <i>roman</i>, <i>fabliau</i> and <i>chanson</i> into the
metres and dialects of the vernacular; and had their share in that
gradual fusion of the racial elements of the land, whose completion was
the preparation for Chaucer.</p>

<p>Besides the Saxons, there were the Kelts. In the provinces of France
that bordered on Armorica, in the English counties that marched
with Wales, the Keltic harper is no unusual or negligible figure.
Whether such minstrels ranked very high in the bardic hierarchy of
their own peoples may be doubted; but amid alien folk they achieved
popularity<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. Both Giraldus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> Cambrensis and Thomas the author of
<i>Tristan</i> speak of a certain <i>famosus fabulator</i> of this
class, Bledhericus or Breri by name<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. Through Breri and his
like the Keltic traditions filtered into Romance literature, and an
important body of scholars are prepared to find in <i>lais</i> sung to
a Welsh or Breton harp the <i>origines</i> of Arthurian romance<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.
In England the Welsh, like the English-speaking minstrels, had a
political, as well as a literary significance. They were the means by
which the spirit of Welsh disaffection under English rule was kept
alive, and at times fanned into a blaze. The fable of the massacre
of the bards by Edward I is now discredited, but an ordinance of his
against Keltic ‘bards and rhymers’ is upon record, and was subsequently
repeated under Henry IV<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.</p>

<p>An important question now presents itself. How far, in this
heterogeneous welter of mediaeval minstrelsy, is it possible to
distinguish any elements which can properly be called dramatic? The
minstrels were entertainers in many <i>genres</i>. Were they also
actors? An answer may be sought first of all in their literary remains.
The first condition of drama is dialogue, and dialogue is found both in
lyric and in narrative minstrelsy. Naturally, it is scantiest in lyric.
But there is a group of <i>chansons</i> common to northern France
and to southern France or Provence, which at least tended to develop
in this direction. There are the <i>chansons à danser</i>, which are
frequently a semi-dialogue between a soloist and a chorus, the one
singing the verses, the other breaking into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> a burden or refrain. There
are the <i>chansons à personnages</i> or <i>chansons de mal mariée</i>,
complaints of unhappy wives, which often take the form of a dialogue
between the woman and her husband, her friend or, it may be, the
poet, occasionally that of a discussion on courtly love in general.
There are the <i>aubes</i>, of which the type is the morning dialogue
between woman and lover adapted by Shakespeare with such splendid
effect in the third act of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. And finally there
are the <i>pastourelles</i>, which are generally dialogues between
a knight and a shepherdess, in which the knight makes love and,
successful or repulsed, rides away. All these <i>chansons</i>, like the
<i>chansons d’histoire</i> or <i>de toile</i>, which did not develop
into dialogues, are, in the form in which we have them, of minstrel
origin. But behind them are probably folk-songs of similar character,
and M. Gaston Paris is perhaps right in tracing them to the <i>fêtes
du mai</i>, those agricultural festivals of immemorial antiquity in
which women traditionally took so large a part. A further word will
have to be said of their ultimate contribution to drama in a future
chapter<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>Other lyrical dialogues of very different type found their way into
the literature of northern France from that of Provence. These were
the elaborate disputes about abstract questions, generally of love, so
dear to the artistic and scholastic mind of the <i>trobaire</i>. There
was the <i>tenson</i> (Fr. <i>tençon</i>) in which two speakers freely
discussed a given subject, each taking the point of view which seems
good to him. And there was the <i>joc-partitz</i> or <i>partimen</i>
(Fr. <i>jeu-parti</i> or <i>parture</i>), in which the challenger
proposed a theme, indicated two opposed attitudes towards it, and gave
his opponent his choice to maintain one or other<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. Originally, no
doubt the <i>tensons</i> and the <i>jocs-partitz</i> were, as they
professed to be, improvised verbal tournaments: afterwards they became
little more than academic exercises<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>. To the drama they have
nothing to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>The dialogue elements in lyric minstrelsy thus exhausted, we turn to
the wider field of narrative. But over the greater space of this field
we look in vain. If there is anything of dialogue in the <i>chansons
de gestes</i> and the <i>romans</i> it is merely reported dialogue
such as every form of narrative poetry contains, and is not to the
purpose. It is not until we come to the humbler branches of narrative,
the unimportant <i>contes</i> and <i>dits</i>, that we find ourselves
in the presence of dialogue proper. <i>Dits</i> and <i>fabliaux
dialogués</i> are not rare<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. There is the already quoted <i>Deus
Bordeors Ribauz</i> in which two <i>jougleurs</i> meet and vaunt in
turn their rival proficiencies in the various branches of their common
art<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. There is Rutebeuf’s <i>Charlot et le Barbier</i>, a similar
‘flyting’ between two gentlemen of the road<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. There is <i>Courtois
d’Arras</i>, a version of the Prodigal Son story<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. There is <i>Le
Roi d’Angleterre et le Jongleur d’Ely</i>, a specimen of witty minstrel
repartee, of which more will be said immediately. These dialogues
naturally tend to become of the nature of disputes, and they merge into
that special kind of <i>dit</i>, the <i>débat</i> or <i>disputoison</i>
proper. The <i>débat</i> is a kind of poetical controversy put into
the mouths of two types or two personified abstractions, each of which
pleads the cause of its own superiority, while in the end the decision
is not infrequently referred to an umpire in the fashion familiar in
the eclogues of Theocritus<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. The <i>débats</i> thus bear a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
resemblance to the lyric <i>tençons</i> and <i>jeux-partis</i> already
mentioned. Like the <i>chansons</i>, they probably owe something
to the folk festivals with their ‘flytings’ and seasonal songs. In
any case they are common ground to minstrelsy and to the clerkly
literature of the Middle Ages. Many of the most famous of them, such
as the <i>Débat de l’Hiver et de l’Été</i>, the <i>Débat du Vin et de
l’Eau</i>, the <i>Débat du Corps et de l’Âme</i>, exist in neo-Latin
forms, the intermediaries being naturally enough those <i>vagantes</i>
or wandering scholars, to whom so much of the interaction of learned
and of popular literature must be due<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. And in their turn many
of the <i>débats</i> were translated sooner or later into English.
English literature, indeed, had had from Anglo-Saxon days a natural
affinity for the dialogue form<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> and presents side by side with
the translated <i>débats</i> others—<i>strifs</i> or <i>estrifs</i>
is the English term—of native origin<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. The thirteenth-century
<i>Harrowing of Hell</i> is an <i>estrif</i> on a subject familiar in
the miracle plays: and for an early miracle play it has sometimes been
mistaken<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. Two or three other <i>estrifs</i> of English origin are
remarkable, because the interlocutors are not exactly abstractions, but
species of birds and animals<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<p>Dialogue then, in one shape or another, was part of the minstrel’s
regular stock-in-trade. But dialogue by itself is not drama. The
notion of drama does not, perhaps, necessarily imply scenery on a
regular stage, but it does imply impersonation and a distribution
of rôles between at least two performers. Is there anything to be
traced in minstrelsy that satisfies these conditions? So far as
impersonation is concerned, there are several scattered notices which
seem to show that it was not altogether unknown. In the twelfth
century for instance, Ælred, abbot of Rievaulx, commenting on certain
unpleasing innovations in the church services of the day, complains
that the singers use gestures just like those of <i>histriones</i>,
fit rather for a <i>theatrum</i> than for a house of prayer<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.
The word <i>theatrum</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span> is, however, a little suspicious, for
an actual theatre in the twelfth century is hardly thinkable, and
with a learned ecclesiastic one can never be sure that he is not
drawing his illustrations rather from his knowledge of classical
literature than from the real life around him. It is more conclusive,
perhaps, when <i>fabliaux</i> or <i>contes</i> speak of minstrels
as ‘doing’ <i>l’ivre</i>, or <i>le cat</i>, or <i>le sot</i><a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>;
or when it appears from contemporary accounts that at a performance
in Savoy the manners of England and Brittany were mimicked<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. In
Provence <i>contrafazedor</i> seems to have been a regular name for
a minstrel<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>; and the facts that the minstrels wore masks ‘with
intent to deceive’<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, and were forbidden to wear ecclesiastical
dresses<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>, also point to something in the way of rudimentary
impersonation.</p>

<p>As for the distribution of rôles, all that can be said, so far as the
<i>débats</i> and <i>dits dialogués</i> go, is, that while some of
them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> may conceivably have been represented by more than one performer,
none of them need necessarily have been so, and some of them certainly
were not. There is generally a narrative introduction and often a
sprinkling of narrative interspersed amongst the dialogue. These
parts may have been pronounced by an <i>auctor</i> or by one of the
interlocutors acting as <i>auctor</i>, and some such device must have
been occasionally necessitated in the religious drama. But there is
really no difficulty in supposing the whole of these pieces to have
been recited by a single minstrel with appropriate changes of gesture
and intonation, and in <i>The Harrowing of Hell</i>, which begins ‘A
strif will I tellen of,’ this was clearly the case. The evidences of
impersonation given above are of course quite consistent with such an
arrangement; or, for the matter of that, with sheer monologue. The
minstrel who recited Rutebeuf’s <i>Dit de l’Erberie</i> may readily be
supposed to have got himself up in the character of a quack<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

<p>But the possibilities of secular mediaeval drama are not quite
exhausted by the <i>débats</i> and <i>dits dialogués</i>. For after
all, the written literature which the minstrels have left us belongs
almost entirely to those higher <i>strata</i> of their complex
fraternity which derived from the thoroughly undramatic Teutonic
<i>scôp</i>. But if mediaeval farce there were, it would not be here
that we should look for it. It would belong to the inheritance, not
of the <i>scôp</i>, but of the <i>mimus</i>. The Roman <i>mimus</i>
was essentially a player of farces; that and little else. It is of
course open to any one to suppose that the <i>mimus</i> went down in
the seventh century playing farces, and that his like appeared in the
fifteenth century playing farces, and that not a farce was played
between. But is it not more probable on the whole that, while occupying
himself largely with other matters, he preserved at least the rudiments
of the art of acting, and that when the appointed time came, the
despised and forgotten farce, under the stimulus of new conditions,
blossomed forth once more as a vital and effective form of literature?
In the absence of data we are reduced to conjecture. But the mere
absence of data itself does not render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> the conjecture untenable. For
if such rudimentary, or, if you please, degenerate farces as I have in
mind, ever existed in the Middle Ages, the chances were all against
their literary survival. They were assuredly very brief, very crude,
often improvised, and rarely, if ever, written down. They belonged
to an order of minstrels far below that which made literature<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.
And one little bit of evidence which has not yet been brought forward
seems to point to the existence of something in the way of a secular
as well as a religious mediaeval drama. In the well-known Wyclifite
sermon against miracle plays, an imaginary opponent of the preacher’s
argument is made to say that after all it is ‘lesse yvels that thei
have thyre recreaceon by pleyinge of myraclis than bi pleyinge of
other japis’; and again that ‘to pley in rebaudye’ is worse than ‘to
pley in myriclis<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.’ Now, there is of course no necessary dramatic
connotation either in the word ‘pley’ or in the word ‘japis,’ which,
like ‘bourde’ or ‘gab’ is frequently used of any kind of rowdy
merriment, or of the lower types of minstrelsy in general<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. But on
the other hand the whole tone of the passage seems to draw a very close
parallel between the ‘japis’ and the undeniably dramatic ‘myriclis,’
and to imply something in the former a little beyond the mere
recitation, even with the help of impersonation, of a solitary mime.</p>

<p>Such rude farces or ‘japis’ as we are considering, if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> formed
part of the travelling equipment of the humbler mimes, could only get
into literature by an accident; in the event, that is to say, of some
minstrel of a higher class taking it into his head to experiment in
the form or to adapt it to the purposes of his own art. And this is
precisely what appears to have happened. A very natural use of the
farce would be in the <i>parade</i> or preliminary patter, merely
about himself and his proficiency, which at all times has served the
itinerant entertainer as a means whereby to attract his audiences. And
just as the very similar <i>boniment</i> or patter of the mountebank
charlatan at a fair became the model for Rutebeuf’s <i>Dit de
l’Erberie</i>, so the <i>parade</i> may be traced as the underlying
motive of other <i>dits</i> or <i>fabliaux</i>. The <i>Deus Bordeors
Ribauz</i> is itself little other than a glorified <i>parade</i>, and
another, very slightly disguised, may be found in the discomfiture of
the king by the characteristic repartees of the wandering minstrel
in <i>Le Roi d’Angleterre et le Jougleur d’Ely</i><a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>. The
<i>parade</i>, also, seems to be the origin of a certain familiar type
of dramatic prologue in which the author or the presenters of a play
appear in their own persons. The earliest example of this is perhaps
that enigmatic <i>Terentius et Delusor</i> piece which some have
thought to point to a representation of Terence somewhere in the dark
ages between the seventh and the eleventh century<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. And there is a
later one in the <i>Jeu du Pèlerin</i> which was written about 1288 to
precede Adan de la Hale’s <i>Jeu de Robin et Marion</i>.</p>

<p>The renascence of farce in the fifteenth century will call for
consideration in a later chapter. It is possible that, as is here
suggested, that renascence was but the coming to light again of an
earth-bourne of dramatic tradition that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> worked its way beneath
the ground ever since the theatres of the Empire fell. In any case,
rare documents of earlier date survive to show that it was at least
no absolutely sudden and unprecedented thing. The <i>jeux</i> of
Adan de la Hale, indeed, are somewhat irrelevant here. They were not
farces, and will fall to be dealt with in the discussion of the popular
<i>fêtes</i> from which they derive their origin<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. But the French
farce of <i>Le Garçon et l’Aveugle</i>, ascribed to the second half
of the thirteenth century, is over a hundred years older than any of
its extant successors<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>. And even more interesting to us, because
it is of English <i>provenance</i> and in the English tongue, is a
fragment found in an early fourteenth-century manuscript of a dramatic
version of the popular mediaeval tale of Dame Siriz<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. This bears
the heading <i>Hic incipit interludium de Clerico et Puella</i>. But
the significance of this fateful word <i>interludium</i> must be left
for study at a later period, when the history of the secular drama is
resumed from the point at which it must now be dropped.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—The conversion of heathen England
is described in the <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> of Bede (C.
Plummer, <i>Baedae Opera Historica</i>, 1896). Stress is laid
on the imperfect character of the process by L. Knappert, <i>Le
Christianisme et le Paganisme dans l’Histoire ecclésiastique
de Bède le Vénérable</i> (in <i>Revue de l’Histoire des
Religions</i>, 1897, vol. xxxv). A similar study for Gaul is E.
Vacandard, <i>L’Idolatrie dans la Gaule</i> (in <i>Revue des
Questions historiques</i>, 1899, vol. lxv). Witness is borne
to the continued presence of pre-Christian elements in the
folk-civilization of western Europe both by the general results
of folk-lore research and by the ecclesiastical documents of the
early Middle Ages. Of these the most important in this respect
are—(1) the <i>Decrees</i> of Councils, collected generally in
P. Labbe and G. Cossart, <i>Sacrosancta Concilia</i> (1671-2),
and J. D. Mansi, <i>Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima
Collectio</i> (1759-98), and for England in particular in D.
Wilkins, <i>Concilia Magnae Britanniae et Hiberniae</i> (1737)
and A. W. Haddan and W. Stubbs, <i>Councils and Ecclesiastical
Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland</i> (1869-78).
An interesting series of extracts is given by G. Gröber,
<i>Zur Volkskunde aus Concilbeschlüssen und Capitularien</i>
(1894):—(2) the <i>Penitentials</i>, or catalogues of sins
and their penalties drawn up for the guidance of confessors.
The most important English example is the <i>Penitential of
Theodore</i> (668-90), on which the <i>Penitentials of Bede</i>
and <i>of Egbert</i> are based. Authentic texts are given by
Haddan and Stubbs, vol. iii, and, with others of continental
origin, in F. W. H. Wasserschleben, <i>Die Bussordnungen der
abendländischen Kirche</i> (1851), and H. J. Schmitz, <i>Die
Bussbücher und die Bussdisciplin der Kirche</i> (1883). The most
interesting for its heathen survivals is the eleventh-century
<i>Collectio Decretorum</i> of Burchardus of Worms (Migne, <i>P.
L.</i> cxl, extracts in J. Grimm, <i>Teutonic Mythology</i>,
iv. 1740):—(3) <i>Homilies</i> or <i>Sermons</i>, such as
the <i>Sermo</i> ascribed to the seventh-century St. Eligius
(<i>P. L.</i> lxxxvii. 524, transl. Grimm, iv. 1737), and
the eighth-century Frankish pseudo-Augustinian <i>Homilia de
Sacrilegiis</i> (ed. C. P. Caspari, 1886):—(4) the <i>Vitae</i>
of the apostles of the West, St. Boniface, St. Columban, St.
Gall, and others. A critical edition of these is looked for
from M. Knappert. The <i>Epistolae</i> of Boniface are in
<i>P. L.</i> lxxxix. 593:—(5) <i>Miscellaneous Documents</i>,
including the sixth-century <i>De correctione Rusticorum</i> of
Bishop Martin of Braga in Spain (ed. C. P. Caspari, 1883) and
the so-called <i>Indiculus Superstitionum et Paganiarum</i> (ed.
H. A. Saupe, 1891), a list of heathen customs probably drawn up
in eighth-century Saxony.—The view of primitive religion taken
in this book is largely, although not altogether in detail,
that of J. G. Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i> (1890, 2nd ed.
1900), which itself owes much to E. B. Tylor, <i>Primitive
Culture</i> (1871); W. Robertson Smith, <i>Religion of the
Semites</i> (2nd ed. 1894); W. Mannhardt, <i>Der Baumkultus der
Germanen</i> (1875); <i>Antike Wald-und Feldkulte</i> (1875-7).
A more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> systematic work on similar lines is F. B. Jevons, <i>An
Introduction to the History of Religion</i> (1896): and amongst
many others may be mentioned A. Lang, <i>Myth, Ritual, and
Religion</i> (1887, 2nd ed. 1899), the conclusions of which
are somewhat modified in the same writer’s <i>The Making of
Religion</i> (1898); Grant Allen, <i>The Evolution of the Idea
of God</i> (1897); E. S. Hartland, <i>The Legend of Perseus</i>
(1894-6); J. Rhys, <i>The Origin and Growth of Religion as
illustrated by Celtic Heathendom</i> (1888). The last of these
deals especially with Keltic <i>data</i>, which may be further
studied in H. D’Arbois de Jubainville, <i>Le Cycle mythologique
irlandais et la Mythologie celtique</i> (1884), together with
the chapter on <i>La Religion</i> in the same writer’s <i>La
Civilisation des Celtes et celle de l’Épopée homérique</i> (1899)
and A. Bertrand, <i>La Religion des Gaulois</i> (1897). Teutonic
religion has been more completely investigated. Recent works of
authority are E. H. Meyer, <i>Germanische Mythologie</i> (1891);
W. Golther, <i>Handbuch der germanischen Mythologie</i> (1895);
and the article by E. Mogk on <i>Mythologie</i> in H. Paul’s
<i>Grundriss der germanischen Philologie</i>, vol. iii (2nd ed.
1897). The collection of material in J. Grimm’s <i>Teutonic
Mythology</i> (transl. J. S. Stallybrass, 1880-8) is still of the
greatest value. The general facts of early German civilization
are given by F. B. Gummere, <i>Germanic Origins</i> (1892),
and for the Aryan-speaking peoples in general by O. Schräder,
<i>Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples</i> (transl.
F. B. Jevons, 1890), and <i>Reallexicon der indo-germanischen
Altertumskunde</i> (1901). In dealing with the primitive calendar
I have mainly, but not wholly, followed the valuable researches
of A. Tille, <i>Deutsche Weihnacht</i> (1893) and <i>Yule and
Christmas</i> (1899), a scholar the loss of whom to this country
is one of the lamentable results of the recent war.]</p>

<p>Minstrelsy was an institution of the folk, no less than of the court
and the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. At many a village festival, one may
be sure, the taberers and buffoons played their conspicuous part,
ravishing the souls of Dorcas and Mopsa with merry and doleful ballads,
and tumbling through their amazing programme of monkey tricks before
the ring of wide-mouthed rustics on the green. Yet the soul and
centre of such revels always lay, not in these alien professional
<i>spectacula</i>, but in other entertainments, home-grown and racy
of the soil, wherein the peasants shared, not as onlookers only, but
as performers, even as their fathers and mothers, from immemorial
antiquity, had done before them. A full consideration of the village
<i>ludi</i> is important to the scheme of the present book for more
than one reason. They shared with the <i>ludi</i> of the minstrels the
hostility of the Church. They bear witness, at point after point, to
the deep-lying dramatic instincts of the folk. And their substantial
contribution to mediaeval and Renaissance drama and dramatic
<i>spectacle</i> is greater than has been fully recognized.</p>

<p>Historically, the <i>ludi</i> of the folk come into prominence with
the attacks made upon them by the reforming ecclesiastics of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> the
thirteenth century and in particular by Robert Grosseteste, bishop
of Lincoln<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>. Between 1236 and 1244 Grosseteste issued a series
of disciplinary pronouncements, in which he condemned many customs
prevalent in his diocese. Amongst these are included miracle plays,
‘scotales’ or drinking-bouts, ‘ram-raisings’ and other contests of
athletic prowess, together with ceremonies known respectively as the
<i>festum stultorum</i> and the <i>Inductio Maii sive Autumni</i><a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.
Very similar are the prohibitions contained in the <i>Constitutions</i>
(1240) of Walter de Chanteloup, bishop of Worcester<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. These
particularly specify the <i>ludus de Rege et Regina</i>, a term
which may be taken as generally applicable to the typical English
folk-festival, of which the <i>Inductio Maii sive Autumni</i>,
the ‘May-game’ and ‘mell-supper,’ mentioned by Grosseteste, are
varieties<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. Both this <i>ludus</i>, in its various forms, and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> less strictly popular <i>festum stultorum</i>, will find ample
illustration in the sequel. Walter de Chanteloup also lays stress upon
an aggravation of the <i>ludi inhonesti</i> by the performance of them
in churchyards and other holy places, and on Sundays or the vigils and
days of saints<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.</p>

<p>The decrees of the two bishops already cited do not stand alone.
About 1250 the University of Oxford found it necessary to forbid
the routs of masked and garlanded students in the churches and open
places of the city<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>. These appear to have been held in connexion
with the feasts of the ‘nations’ into which a mediaeval university
was divided. Articles of visitation drawn up in connexion with the
provisions of Oxford in 1253 made inquiry as to several of the
obnoxious <i>ludi</i> and as to the measures adopted to check them
throughout the country<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. Prohibitions are upon record by the synod
of Exeter in 1287<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>, and during the next century by the synod of
York in 1367<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>, and by William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester,
in 1384<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>; while the denunciations of the rulers of the church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
find an unofficial echo in that handbook of ecclesiastical morality,
Robert Mannyng of Brunne’s <i>Handlyng Synne</i><a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>. There is,
however, reason to suppose that the attitude thus taken up hardly
represents that of the average ecclesiastical authority, still
less that of the average parish priest, towards the <i>ludi</i> in
question. The condemnatory decrees should probably be looked upon as
the individual pronouncements of men of austere or reforming temper
against customs which the laxer discipline of their fellows failed to
touch; perhaps it should rather be said, which the wiser discipline
of their fellows found it better to regulate than to ban. At any rate
there is evidence to show that the village <i>ludi</i>, as distinct
from the <i>spectacula</i> of the minstrels, were accepted, and even to
some extent directed, by the Church. They became part of the parochial
organization, and were conducted through the parochial machinery.
Doubtless this was the course of practical wisdom. But the moralist
would find it difficult to deny that Robert Grosseteste and Walter de
Chanteloup had, after all, some reason on their side. On the one hand
they could point to the ethical lapses of which the <i>ludi</i> were
undoubtedly the cause—the drunkenness, the quarrels, the wantonings,
by which they were disgraced<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>. And on the other they could—if
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> were historically minded—recall the origin of the objectionable
rites in some of those obscure survivals of heathenism in the rustic
blood, which half a dozen centuries of Christianity had failed to
purge<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. For if the comparative study of religions proves anything
it is, that the traditional beliefs and customs of the mediaeval or
modern peasant are in nine cases out of ten but the <i>detritus</i>
of heathen mythology and heathen worship, enduring with but little
external change in the shadow of an hostile creed. This is notably true
of the village festivals and their <i>ludi</i>. Their full significance
only appears when they are regarded as fragments of forgotten cults,
the naïve cults addressed by a primitive folk to the beneficent deities
of field and wood and river, or the shadowy populace of its own
dreams. Not that when even the mediaeval peasant set up his May-pole
at the approach of summer or drove his cattle through the bonfire on
Midsummer eve, the real character of his act was at all explicit in his
consciousness. To him, as to his descendant of to-day, the festival was
at once a practice sanctioned by tradition and the rare amusement of
a strenuous life: it was not, save perhaps in some unplumbed recesses
of his being, anything more definitely sacred. At most it was held
to be ‘for luck,’ and in some vague general way, to the interest of
a fruitful year in field and fold. The scientific anthropologist,
however, from his very different point of view, cannot regard the
conversion to Christianity as a complete solution of continuity in
the spiritual and social life of western Europe. This conversion,
indeed, was clearly a much slower and more incomplete process than the
ecclesiastical chroniclers quite plainly state. It was so even on the
shores of the Mediterranean. But there the triumph of Christianity
began from below. Long before the edict of Milan, the new religion,
in spite of persecutions, had got its firm hold upon the masses of
the great cities of the Empire. And when, less than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span> century later,
Theodosius made the public profession of any other faith a crime, he
was but formally acknowledging a <i>chose jugée</i>. But even in these
lands of the first ardour the old beliefs and, above all, the old
rituals died hard. Lingering unacknowledged in the country, the pagan,
districts, they passed silently into the dim realm of folk-lore. How
could this but be more so when Christianity came with the missionaries
of Rome or of Iona to the peoples of the West? For with them conversion
was hardly a spontaneous, an individual thing. As a rule, the baptism
of the king was the starting-point and motive for that of his
followers: and the bulk of the people adopted wonderingly an alien cult
in an alien tongue imposed upon them by the will of their rulers. Such
a Christianity could at best be only nominal. Ancient beliefs are not
so easily surrendered: nor are habits and instincts, deep-rooted in
the lives of a folk, thus lightly laid down for ever, at the word of a
king. The churches of the West had, therefore, to dispose somehow of a
vast body of practical heathenism surviving in all essentials beneath
a new faith which was but skin-deep. The conflict which followed is
faintly adumbrated in the pages of Bede: something more may be guessed
of its fortunes by a comparison of the customs and superstitions
recorded in early documents of church discipline with those which,
after all, the peasantry long retained, or even now retain.</p>

<p>Two letters of Gregory the Great, written at the time of the mission
of St. Augustine, are a key to the methods adopted by the apostles of
the West. In June 601, writing to Ethelbert of Kent by the hands of
abbot Mellitus, Gregory bade the new convert show zeal in suppressing
the worship of idols, and throwing down their fanes<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. Having
written thus, the pope changed his mind. Before Mellitus could reach
England, he received a letter instructing him to expound to Augustine
a new policy. ‘Do not, after all,’ wrote Gregory, ‘pull down the
fanes. Destroy the idols; purify the buildings with holy water; set
relics there; and let them become temples of the true God. So the
people will have no need to change their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> places of concourse, and
where of old they were wont to sacrifice cattle to demons, thither let
them continue to resort on the day of the saint to whom the church is
dedicated, and slay their beasts no longer as a sacrifice, but for a
social meal in honour of Him whom they now worship<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.’ There can be
little doubt that the conversion of England proceeded in the main on
the lines thus laid down by Gregory. Tradition has it that the church
of Saint Pancras outside the walls of Canterbury stands on the site of
a fane at which Ethelbert himself once worshipped<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>; and that in
London St. Paul’s replaced a temple and grove of Diana, by whom the
equivalent Teutonic wood-goddess, Freyja, is doubtless intended<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.
Gregory’s directions were, perhaps, not always carried out quite so
literally as this. When, for instance, the priest Coifi, on horseback
and sword in hand, led the onslaught against the gods of Northumbria,
he bade his followers set fire to the fane and to all the hedges that
girt it round<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>. On the other hand, Reduald, king of East Anglia,
must have kept his fane standing, and indeed he carried the policy
of amalgamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> further than its author intended, for he wavered
faint-heartedly between the old religion and the new, and maintained in
one building an <i>altare</i> for Christian worship and an <i>arula</i>
for sacrifice to demons<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. Speaking generally, it would seem to have
been the endeavour of the Christian missionaries to effect the change
of creed with as little dislocation of popular sentiment as possible.
If they could extirpate the essentials, or what they considered as
the essentials, of heathenism, they were willing enough to leave the
accidentals to be worn away by the slow process of time. They did not,
probably, quite realize how long it would take. And what happened in
England, happened also, no doubt, on the continent, save perhaps in
such districts as Saxony, where Christianity was introduced <i>vi et
armis</i>, and therefore in a more wholesale, if not in the end a more
effectual fashion<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>.</p>

<p>The measure of surviving heathenism under Christianity must have
varied considerably from district to district. Much would depend on
the natural temper of the converts, on the tact of the clergy and on
the influence they were able to secure. Roughly speaking, the old
worships left their trace upon the new society in two ways. Certain
central practices, the deliberate invocation of the discarded gods, the
deliberate acknowledgement of their divinity by sacrifice, were bound
to be altogether proscribed<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. And these, if they did not precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
vanish, at least went underground, coming to light only as shameful
secrets of the confessional<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> or the witch-trial<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>, or when the
dominant faith received a rude shock in times of especial distress,
famine or pestilence<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. Others again were absorbed into the scheme
of Christianity itself. Many of the protective functions, for instance,
of the old pantheon were taken over bodily by the Virgin Mary, by St.
John, St. Michael, St. Martin, St. Nicholas, and other personages of
the new dispensation<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. And in particular, as we have seen shadowed
forth in Pope Gregory’s policy, the festal customs of heathenism,
purified so far as might be, received a generous amount of toleration.
The chief thing required was that the outward and visible signs of the
connexion with the hostile religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> should be abandoned. Nor was this
such a difficult matter. Cult, the sum of what man feels it obligatory
upon him to do in virtue of his relation to the unseen powers, is
notoriously a more enduring thing than belief, the speculative, or
mythology, the imaginative statement of those relations. And it was
of the customs themselves that the people were tenacious, not of the
meaning, so far as there was still a meaning, attached to them, or
of the names which their priests had been wont to invoke. Leave them
but their familiar revels, and the ritual so indissolubly bound up
with their hopes of fertility for their flocks and crops, they would
not stick upon the explicit consciousness that they drank or danced
in the might of Eostre or of Freyr. And in time, as the Christian
interpretation of life became an everyday thing, it passed out of sight
that the customs had been ritual at all. At the most a general sense
of their ‘lucky’ influence survived. But to stop doing them; that was
not likely to suggest itself to the rustic mind. And so the church and
the open space around the church continued to be, what the temple and
the temple precinct had been, the centre, both secular and religious,
of the village life. From the Christian point of view, the arrangement
had its obvious advantages. It had also this disadvantage, that so
far as obnoxious elements still clung to the festivals, so far as the
darker practices of heathenism still lingered, it was precisely the
most sacred spot that they defiled. Were incantations and spells still
muttered secretly for the good will of the deposed divinities? it was
the churchyard that was sure to be selected as the nocturnal scene of
the unhallowed ceremony. Were the clergy unable to cleanse the yearly
wake of wanton dance and song? it was the church itself, by Gregory’s
own decree, that became the focus of the riot.</p>

<p>The partial survival of the village ceremonies under Christianity will
appear less surprising when it is borne in mind that the heathenism
which Christianity combated was itself only the final term of a long
process of evolution. The worshippers of the Keltic or Teutonic deities
already practised a traditional ritual, probably without any very
clear conception of the <i>rationale</i> on which some at least of the
acts which they performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> were based. These acts had their origin far
back in the history of the religious consciousness; and it must not be
supposed, because modern scholarship, with its comparative methods, is
able to some extent to reconstruct the mental conditions out of which
they arose, that these conditions were still wholly operative in the
sixth, any more than in the thirteenth or the twentieth century. Side
by side with customs which had still their definite and intelligible
significance, religious conservatism had certainly preserved others
of a very primitive type, some of which survived as mere fossils,
while others had undergone that transformation of intention, that
pouring of new wine into old bottles, which is one of the most familiar
features in the history of institutions. The heathenism of western
Europe must be regarded, therefore, as a group of religious practices
originating in very different strata of civilization, and only fused
together in the continuity of tradition. Its permanence lay in the
law of association through which a piece of ritual originally devised
by the folk to secure their practical well-being remained, even after
the initial meaning grew obscure, irrevocably bound up with their
expectations of that well-being. Its interest to the student is that of
a development, rather than that of a system. Only the briefest outline
of the direction taken by this development can be here indicated. But
it must first be pointed out that, whether from a common derivation,
or through a similar intellectual structure reacting upon similar
conditions of life, it seems, at least up to the point of emergence
of the fully formed village cult, to have proceeded on uniform lines,
not only amongst the Teutonic and Keltic tribes who inhabited western
and northern Europe and these islands, but also amongst all the
Aryan-speaking peoples. In particular, although the Teutonic and the
Keltic priests and bards elaborated, probably in comparatively late
stages of their history, very different god-names and very different
mythologies, yet these are but the superstructure of religion; and it
is possible to infer, both from the results of folk-lore and from the
more scanty documentary evidence, a substantial identity throughout
the whole Kelto-Teutonic group, of the underlying institutions
of ritual and of the fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> theological conceptions<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.
I am aware that it is no longer permissible to sum up all the
facts of European civilization in an Aryan formula. Ethnology has
satisfactorily established the existence on the continent of at least
two important racial strains besides that of the blonde invader from
Latham-land<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>. But I do not think that any of the attempts hitherto
made to distinguish Aryan from pre-Aryan elements in folk-lore have
met with any measure of success<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>. Nor is it quite clear that any
such distinction need have been implied by the difference of blood.
Archaeologists speak of a remarkable uniformity of material culture
throughout the whole of Europe during the neolithic period; and there
appears to be no special reason why this uniformity may not have
extended to the comparatively simple notions which man was led to form
of the not-man by his early contacts with his environment. In any case
the social amalgamation of Aryan and pre-Aryan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> was a process already
complete by the Middle Ages; and for the purpose of this investigation
it seems justifiable, and in the present state of knowledge even
necessary, to treat the village customs as roughly speaking homogeneous
throughout the whole of the Kelto-Teutonic area.</p>

<p>An analysis of these customs suggests a mental history somewhat as
follows. The first relations of man to the not-man are, it need hardly
be said, of a practical rather than a sentimental or a philosophic
character. They arise out of an endeavour to procure certain goods
which depend, in part at least, upon natural processes beyond man’s
own control. The chief of these goods is, of course, food; that is to
say, in a primitive state of civilization, success in hunting, whether
of berries, mussels and ‘witchetty grubs,’ or of more elusive and
difficult game; and later, when hunting ceases to be the mainstay of
existence, the continued fertility of the flocks and herds, which form
the support of a pastoral race, and of the cornfields and orchards
which in their turn come to supplement these, on the appearance of
agriculture. Food once supplied, the little tale of primitive man’s
limited conception of the desirable is soon completed. Fire and a
roof-tree are his already. But he asks for physical health, for
success in love and in the begetting of offspring, and for the power
to anticipate by divination that future about which he is always so
childishly curious. In the pursuit, then, of these simple goods man
endeavours to control nature. But his earliest essays in this direction
are, as Dr. Frazer has recently pointed out, not properly to be called
religion<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>. The magical charms by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span> which he attempts to make the
sun burn, and the waters fall, and the wind blow as it pleases him,
certainly do not imply that recognition of a quasi-human personality
outside himself, which any religious definition may be supposed to
require as a minimum. They are rather to be regarded as applications of
primitive science, for they depend upon a vague general notion of the
relations of cause and effect. To assume that you can influence a thing
through what is similar to it, or through what has been in contact with
it, which, according to Dr. Frazer, are the postulates of magic in its
mimetic and its sympathetic form respectively, may be bad science, but
at least it is science of a sort, and not religion.</p>

<p>The magical charms play a large part in the village ritual, and will
be illustrated in the following chapter. Presently, however, the
scientific spirit is modified by that tendency of animism through
which man comes to look upon the external world not as mere more or
less resisting matter to be moved hither or thither, but rather as a
debateable land peopled with spirits in some sense alive. These spirits
are the active forces dimly discerned by human imagination as at work
behind the shifting and often mysterious natural phenomena—forces of
the moving winds and waters, of the skies now clear, now overcast, of
the animal races of hill and plain, of the growth waxing and waning
year by year in field and woodland. The control of nature now means the
control of these powers, and to this object the charms are directed. In
particular, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> at this stage of his development, man conceives
a spirit of that food which still remains in the very forefront of his
aspirations, of his actual food-plant, or of the animal species which
he habitually hunts<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. Of this spirit he initiates a cult, which
rests upon the old magical principle of the mastering efficacy of
direct contact. He binds the spirit literally to him by wearing it as a
garment, or absorbs it into himself in a solemn meal, hoping by either
process to acquire an influence or power over it. Naturally, at this
stage, the spirit becomes to the eye of his imagination phytomorphic or
theriomorphic in aspect. He may conceive it as especially incarnate in
a single sacred plant or animal. But the most critical moment in the
history of animism is that at which the elemental spirits come to be
looked upon as anthropomorphic, made in the likeness of man himself.
This is perhaps due to the identification of them with those other
quasi-human spirits, of whose existence man has by an independent
line of thought also become aware. These are the ghostly spirits of
departed kinsmen, still in some shadowy way inhabiting or revisiting
the house-place. The change does not merely mean that the visible
phytomorphic and theriomorphic embodiments of mental forces sink into
subordination; the plants and animals becoming no more than symbols and
appurtenances of the anthropomorphic spirit, or temporary forms with
which from time to time he invests himself. A transformation of the
whole character of the cult is involved, for man must now approach the
spirits, not merely by charms, although conservatism preserves these
as an element in ritual, but with modifications of the modes in which
he approaches his fellow man. He must beg their favour with submissive
speech or buy it with bribes. And here, with prayer and oblation,
religion in the stricter sense makes its appearance.</p>

<p>The next step of man is from the crowd of animistic spirits to
isolate the god. The notion of a god is much the old notion of an
anthropomorphic elemental spirit, widened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> exalted, and further
removed from sense. Instead of a local and limited home, the god has
his dwelling in the whole expanse of heaven or in some distant region
of space. He transcends and as an object of cult supplants the more
bounded and more concrete personifications of natural forces out of
which he has been evolved. But he does not annul these: they survive
in popular credence as his servants and ministers. It is indeed on the
analogy of the position of the human chief amongst his <i>comitatus</i>
that, in all probability, the conception of the god is largely arrived
at. Comparative philology seems to show that the belief in gods is
common to the Aryan-speaking peoples, and that at the root of all the
cognate mythologies there lies a single fundamental divinity. This is
the Dyaus of the Indians, the Zeus of the Greeks, the Jupiter of the
Romans, the Tiwaz (O.H.G. Zîu, O.N. Týr, A.-S. Tîw) of the Teutons.
He is an embodiment of the great clear sunlit heavens, the dispenser
of light to the huntsman, and of warmth and moisture to the crops.
Side by side with the conception of the heaven-god comes that of his
female counterpart, who is also, though less clearly, indicated in
all the mythologies. In her earliest aspect she is the lady of the
woods and of the blossoming fruitful earth. This primary dualism is an
extremely important factor in the explanation of early religion. The
all-father, the heaven, and the mother-goddess, the earth, are distinct
personalities from the beginning. It does not appear possible to
resolve one into a mere doublet or derivative of the other. Certainly
the marriage of earth and heaven in the showers that fertilize the
crops is one of the oldest and most natural of myths. But it is
generally admitted that myth is determined by and does not determine
the forms of cult. The heaven-god and the earth-goddess must have
already had their separate existence before the priests could hymn
their marriage. An explanation of the dualism is probably to be traced
in the merging of two cults originally distinct. These will have been
sex-cults. Tillage is, of course, little esteemed by primitive man.
It was so with the Germans, even up to the point at which they first
came into contact with the Romans<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. Yet all the Aryan languages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
show some acquaintance with the use of grains<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>. The analogy with
existing savages suggests that European agriculture in its early stages
was an affair of the women. While the men hunted or afterwards tended
their droves of cattle and horses, the women grubbed for roots, and
presently learnt to scratch the surface of the ground, to scatter the
seed, and painfully to garner and grind the scanty produce<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>. As the
avocations of the sexes were distinct, so would their magic or their
religion be. Each would develop rites of its own of a type strictly
determined by its practical ambitions, and each would stand apart from
the rites of the other. The interest of the men would centre in the
boar or stag, that of the women in the fruit-tree or the wheat-sheaf.
To the former the stone altar on the open hill-top would be holy; to
the latter the dim recesses of the impenetrable grove. Presently when
the god concept appeared, the men’s divinity would be a personification
of the illimitable and mysterious heavens beneath which they hunted
and herded, from which the pools were filled with water, and at times
the pestilence was darted in the sun rays; the women’s of the wooded
and deep-bosomed earth out of which their wealth sprang. This would
as naturally take a female as that a male form. Agriculture, however,
was not for ever left solely to the women. In time pasturage and
tillage came to be carried on as two branches of a single pursuit,
and the independent sex-cults which had sprung out of them coalesced
in the common village worship of later days. Certain features of the
primitive differentiation can still be obscurely distinguished. Here
and there one or the other sex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> is barred from particular ceremonies,
or a male priest must perform his mystic functions in woman’s garb.
The heaven-god perhaps remains the especial protector of the cattle,
and the earth-goddess of the corn. But generally speaking they have
all the interests of the farm in a joint tutelage. The stone altar
is set up in the sacred grove; the mystic tree is planted on the
hill-top<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>. Theriomorphic and phytomorphic symbols shadow forth a
single godhead<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. The earth-mother becomes a divinity of light. The
heaven-father takes up his abode in the spreading oak.</p>

<p>The historic religions of heathenism have not preserved either the
primitive dualistic monotheism, if the phrase may be permitted, or
the simplicity of divine functions here sketched. With the advance of
civilization the objects of worship must necessarily take upon them new
responsibilities. If a tribe has its home by the sea, sooner or later
it trusts frail barks to the waters, and to its gods is committed the
charge of sea-faring. When handicrafts are invented, these also become
their care. When the pressure of tribe upon tribe leads to war, they
champion the host in battle. Moral ideas emerge and attach themselves
to their service: and ultimately they become identified with the rulers
of the dead, and reign in the shadowy world beyond the tomb. Another
set of processes combine to produce what is known as polytheism.
The constant application of fixed epithets to the godhead tends in
the long run to break up its unity. Special aspects of it begin to
take on an independent existence. Thus amongst the Teutonic peoples
Tiwaz-Thunaraz, the thunderous sky, gives rise to Thunar or Thor,
and Tiwaz-Frawiaz, the bounteous sky, to Freyr. And so the ancient
heaven-god is replaced by distinct gods of rain and sunshine, who,
with the mother-goddess, form that triad of divinities so prominent
in several European cults<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>. Again as tribes come into contact
with each other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> there is a borrowing of religious conceptions, and
the tribal deities are duplicated by others who are really the same
in origin, but have different names. The mythological speculations of
priests and bards cause further elaboration. The friendly national
gods are contrasted with the dark hostile deities of foreign enemies.
A belief in the culture-hero or semi-divine man, who wrests the gifts
of civilization from the older gods, makes its appearance. Certain
cults, such as that of Druidism, become the starting-point for even
more philosophic conceptions. The personal predilection of an important
worshipper or group of worshippers for this or that deity extends his
vogue. The great event in the later history of Teutonic heathenism is
the overshadowing of earlier cults by that of Odin or Wodan, who seems
to have been originally a ruler of the dead, or perhaps a culture-hero,
and not an elemental god at all<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. The multiplicity of forms under
which essentially the same divinity presents itself in history and in
popular belief may be illustrated by the mother-goddess of the Teutons.
As Freyja she is the female counterpart of Freyr; as Nerthus of Freyr’s
northern doublet, Njordr. When Wodan largely absorbs the elemental
functions, she becomes his wife, as Frîja or Frigg. Through her
association with the heaven-gods, she is herself a heaven-as well as
an earth-goddess<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>, the Eostre of Bede<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>, as well as the Erce of
the Anglo-Saxon ploughing charm<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. She is probably the Tanfana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> of
Tacitus and the Nehellenia of the Romano-Germanic votive stones. If so,
she must have become a goddess of mariners, for Nehellenia seems to be
the Isis of the <i>interpretatio Romana</i>. As earth-goddess she comes
naturally into relation with the dead, and like Odin is a leader of the
rout of souls. In German peasant-lore she survives under various names,
of which Perchta is the most important; in witch-lore, as Diana, and
by a curious mediaeval identification, as Herodias<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. And her more
primitive functions are largely inherited by the Virgin, by St. Walpurg
and by countless local saints.</p>

<p>Most of the imaginative and mythological superstructure so briefly
sketched in the last paragraph must be considered as subsequent in
order of development to the typical village cult. Both before and
in more fragmentary shape after the death of the old Keltic and
Teutonic gods, that continued to be in great measure an amalgam of
traditional rites of forgotten magical or pre-religious import. So
far as the consciousness of the mediaeval or modern peasant directed
it to unseen powers at all, which was but little, it was rather to
some of these more local and bounded spirits who remained in the train
of the gods, than to the gods themselves. For the purposes of the
present discussion, it is sufficient to think of it quite generally
as a cult of the spirits of fertilization, without attaching a very
precise connotation to that term. Unlike the domestic cult of the
ancestral ghosts, conducted for each household by the house-father
at the hearth, it was communal in character. Whatever the tenure of
land may have been,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> there seems no doubt that up to a late period
‘co-aration,’ or co-operative ploughing in open fields, remained the
normal method of tillage, while the cattle of the community roamed in
charge of a public herd over unenclosed pastures and forest lands<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>.
The farm, as a self-sufficing agricultural unit, is a comparatively
recent institution, the development of which has done much to render
the village festivals obsolete. Originally the critical moments of
the agricultural year were the same for the whole village, and the
observances which they entailed were shared in by all.</p>

<p>The observances in question, or rather broken fragments of them, have
now attached themselves to a number of different outstanding dates in
the Christian calendar, and the reconstruction of the original year,
with its seasonal feasts, is a matter of some difficulty<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. The
earliest year that can be traced amongst the Aryan-speaking peoples
was a bipartite one, made up of only two seasons, winter and summer.
For some reason that eludes research, winter preceded summer, just as
night, in the primitive reckoning, preceded day. The divisions seem to
have been determined by the conditions of a pastoral existence passed
in the regularly recurring seasons of central Europe. Winter began when
snow blocked the pastures and the cattle had to be brought home to
the stall: summer when the grass grew green again and there was once
more fodder in the open. Approximately these dates would correspond
to mid-November and mid-March<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. Actually, in the absence of a
calendar, they would vary a little from year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> to year and would perhaps
depend on some significant annual event, such as the first snowstorm
in the one case<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>, in the other the appearance of the first violet,
butterfly or cockchafer, or of one of those migratory birds which still
in popular belief bring good fortune and the summer, the swallow,
cuckoo or stork<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. Both dates would give occasion for religious
ceremonies, together with the natural accompaniment of feasting and
revel. More especially would this be the case at mid-November, when a
great slaughtering of cattle was rendered economically necessary by
the difficulty of stall-feeding the whole herd throughout the winter.
Presently, however, new conditions established themselves. Agriculture
grew in importance, and the crops rather than the cattle became the
central interest of the village life. Fresh feasts sprang up side by
side with the primitive ones, one at the beginning of ploughing about
mid-February, another at the end of harvest, about mid-September.
At the same time the increased supply of dry fodder tended to drive
the annual slaughtering farther on into the winter. More or less
contemporaneously with these processes, the old bipartite year was
changed into a tripartite one by the growth of yet another new feast
during that dangerous period when the due succession of rain and sun
for the crops becomes a matter of the greatest moment to the farmer.
Early summer, or spring, was thus set apart from late summer, or summer
proper<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>. This development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> also may be traced to the influence of
agriculture, whose interest runs in a curve, while that of herding
keeps comparatively a straight course. But as too much sun or too much
wet not only spoils the crops but brings a murrain on the cattle, the
herdsmen fell into line and took their share in the high summer rites.
At first, no doubt, this last feast was a sporadic affair, held for
propitiation of the unfavourable fertilization spirits when the elders
of the village thought it called for. And to the end resort may have
been had to exceptional acts of cult in times of especial distress. But
gradually the occasional ceremony became an annual one, held as soon
as the corn was thick in the green blade and the critical days were at
hand.</p>

<p>So far, there has been no need to assume the existence of a calendar.
How long the actual climatic conditions continued to determine the
dates of the annual feasts can hardly be said. But when a calendar
did make its appearance, the five feasts adapted themselves without
much difficulty to it. The earliest calendar that can be inferred in
central Europe was one, either of Oriental or possibly of Mediterranean
<i>provenance</i>, which divided the year into six tides of threescore
days each<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. The beginnings of these tides almost certainly fell at
about the middle of corresponding months of the Roman calendar<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.
The first would thus be marked by the beginning of winter feast in
mid-November; two others by the beginning of summer feast and the
harvest feast in mid-March and mid-August respectively. A little
accommodation of the seasonal feasts of the farm would be required
to adapt them to the remaining three. And here begins a process of
dislocation of the original dates of customs, now becoming traditional
rather than vital, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> was afterwards extended by successive stages
to a bewildering degree. By this time, with the greater permanence of
agriculture, the system of autumn ploughing had perhaps been invented.
The spring ploughing festival was therefore of less importance, and
bore to be shifted back to mid-January instead of mid-February. Four
of the six tides are now provided with initial feasts. These are
mid-November, mid-January, mid-March, and mid-September. There are,
however, still mid-May and mid-July, and only the high summer feast
to divide between them. I am inclined to believe that a division is
precisely what took place, and that the hitherto fluctuating date of
the summer feast was determined in some localities to mid-May, in
others to mid-July<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.</p>

<p>The European three-score-day-tide calendar is rather an ingenious
conjecture than an ascertained fact of history. When the Germano-Keltic
peoples came under the influence of Roman civilization, they adopted
amongst other things the Roman calendar, first in its primitive form
and then in the more scientific one given to it under Julius Caesar.
The latter divided the year into four quarters and twelve months, and
carried with it a knowledge of the solstices, at which the astronomy
neither of Kelts nor of Germans seems to have previously arrived<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.
The feasts again underwent a process of dislocation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> in order to
harmonize them with the new arrangement. The ceremonies of the winter
feast were pulled back to November 1 or pushed forward to January
1. The high summer feast was attracted from mid-May and mid-July
respectively to the important Roman dates of the <i>Floralia</i> on
May 1 and the summer solstice on June 24. Last of all, to complete
the confusion, came, on the top of three-score-day-tide calendar
and Roman calendar alike, the scheme of Christianity with its host
of major and minor ecclesiastical festivals, some of them fixed,
others movable. Inevitably these in their turn began to absorb the
agricultural customs. The present distribution of the five original
feasts, therefore, is somewhat as follows. The winter feast is spread
over all the winter half of the year from All Souls day to Twelfth
night. A later chapter will illustrate its destiny more in detail. The
ploughing feast is to be sought mainly in Plough Monday, in Candlemas
and in Shrovetide or Carnival<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>; the beginning of summer feast
in Palm Sunday, Easter and St. Mark’s day; the early variety of the
high summer feast probably also in Easter, and certainly in May-day,
St. George’s day, Ascensiontide with its Rogations, Whitsuntide and
Trinity Sunday; the later variety of the same feast in Midsummer day
and Lammastide; and the harvest feast in Michaelmas. These are days
of more or less general observance. Locally, in strict accordance
with the policy of Gregory the Great as expounded to Mellitus, the
floating customs have often settled upon conveniently neighbouring
dates of wakes, rushbearings, kirmesses and other forms of vigil or
dedication festivals<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>; and even, in the utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span> oblivion of their
primitive significance, upon the anniversaries of historical events,
such as Royal Oak day on May 29<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, or Gunpowder day. Finally it
may be noted, that of the five feasts that of high summer is the one
most fully preserved in modern survivals. This is partly because it
comes at a convenient time of year for the out-of-door holiday-making
which serves as a preservative for the traditional rites; partly also
because, while the pastoral element in the feasts of the beginnings of
winter and summer soon became comparatively unimportant through the
subordination of pasturage to tillage, and the ploughing and harvest
feasts tended more and more to become affairs of the individual farm
carried out in close connexion with those operations themselves, the
summer feast retained its communal character and continued to be
celebrated by the whole village for the benefit of everybody’s crops
and trees, and everybody’s flocks and herds<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>. It is therefore
mainly, although not wholly, upon the summer feast that the analysis of
the agricultural ritual to be given in the next chapter will be based.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—A systematic calendar of English

(1894); by treatises on local folk-lore, of which W. Henderson,
<i>Notes on the Folk-Lore of the Northern Counties of England and
the Borders</i> (2nd ed. 1879), C. S. Burne and G. F. Jackson,
<i>Shropshire Folk-Lore</i> (1883-5), and J. Rhys, <i>Celtic
Folk-Lore, Welsh and Manx</i> (1901), are the best; and by the
various publications of the Folk-Lore Society, especially the
series of <i>County Folk-Lore</i> (1895-9) and the successive
periodicals, <i>The Folk-Lore Record</i> (1878-82), <i>Folk-Lore
Journal</i> (1883-9), and <i>Folk-Lore</i> (1890-1903). Popular
accounts of French <i>fêtes</i> are given by E. Cortet, <i>Essai
sur les Fêtes religieuses</i> (1867), and O. Havard, <i>Les
Fêtes de nos Pères</i> (1898). L. J. B. Bérenger-Féraud,
<i>Superstitions et Survivances</i> (1896), is more pretentious,
but not really scholarly. C. Leber, <i>Dissertations relatives à
l’Histoire de France</i> (1826-38), vol. ix, contains interesting
material of an historical character, largely drawn from papers in
the eighteenth-century periodical <i>Le Mercure de France</i>.
Amongst German books, J. Grimm, <i>Teutonic Mythology</i>
(transl. J. S. Stallybrass, 1880-8), H. Pfannenschmidt,
<i>Germanische Erntefeste</i> (1878), and U. Jahn, <i>Die
deutschen Opfergebräuche bei Ackerbau und Viehzucht</i>
(1884), are all excellent. Many of the books mentioned in the
bibliographical note to the last chapter remain useful for the
present and following ones; in particular J. G. Frazer, <i>The
Golden Bough</i> (2nd ed. 1900), is, of course, invaluable.
I have only included in the above list such works of general
range as I have actually made most use of. Many others dealing
with special points are cited in the notes. A fuller guide to
folk-lore literature will be found in M. R. Cox, <i>Introduction

<p>The central fact of the agricultural festivals is the presence in the
village of the fertilization spirit in the visible and tangible form
of flowers and green foliage or of the fruits of the earth. Thus,
when the peasants do their ‘observaunce to a morn of May,’ great
boughs of hawthorn are cut before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span> daybreak in the woods, and carried,
with other seasonable leafage and blossom, into the village street.
Lads plant branches before the doors of their mistresses. The folk
deck themselves, their houses, and the church in green. Some of them
are clad almost entirely in wreaths and tutties, and become walking
bushes, ‘Jacks i’ the green.’ The revel centres in dance and song
around a young tree set up in some open space of the village, or a
more permanent May-pole adorned for the occasion with fresh garlands.
A large garland, often with an anthropomorphic representation of the
fertilization spirit in the form of a doll, parades the streets, and is
accompanied by a ‘king’ or ‘queen,’ or a ‘king’ and ‘queen’ together.
Such a garland finds its place at all the seasonal feasts; but whereas
in spring and summer it is naturally made of the new vegetation, at
harvest it as naturally takes the form of a sheaf, often the last sheaf
cut, of the corn. Then it is known as the ‘harvest-May’ or the ‘neck,’
or if it is anthropomorphic in character, as the ‘kern-baby.’ Summer
and harvest garlands alike are not destroyed when the festival is over,
but remain hung up on the May-pole or the church or the barn-door
until the season for their annual renewing comes round. And sometimes
the grain of the ‘harvest-May’ is mingled in the spring with the
seed-corn<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.</p>

<p>The rationale of such customs is fairly simple. They depend upon a
notion of sympathetic magic carried on into the animistic stage of
belief. Their object is to secure the beneficent influence of the
fertilization spirit by bringing the persons or places to be benefited
into direct contact with the physical embodiment of that spirit. In the
burgeoning quick set up on the village green is the divine presence.
The worshipper clad in leaves and flowers has made himself a garment of
the god, and is therefore in a very special sense under his protection.
Thus efficacy in folk-belief of physical contact may be illustrated by
another set of practices in which recourse is had to the fertilization
spirit for the cure of disease. A child suffering from croup,
convulsions, rickets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> or other ailment, is passed through a hole in
a split tree, or beneath a bramble rooted at both ends, or a strip of
turf partly raised from the ground. It is the actual touch of earth or
stem that works the healing<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>.</p>

<p>May-pole or church may represent a focus of the cult at some specially
sacred tree or grove in the heathen village. But the ceremony, though
it centres at these, is not confined to them, for its whole purpose
is to distribute the benign influence over the entire community,
every field, fold, pasture, orchard close and homestead thereof. At
ploughing, the driving of the first furrow; at harvest, the homecoming
of the last wain, is attended with ritual. Probably all the primitive
festivals, and certainly that of high summer, included a lustration,
in which the image or tree which stood for the fertilization spirit
was borne in solemn procession from dwelling to dwelling and round
all the boundaries of the village. Tacitus records the progress of
the earth-goddess Nerthus amongst the German tribes about the mouth
of the Elbe, and the dipping of the goddess and the drowning of her
slaves in a lake at the term of the ceremony<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>. So too at Upsala in
Sweden the statue of Freyr went round when winter was at an end<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>;
while Sozomenes tells how, when Ulfilas was preaching Christianity
to the Visigoths, Athanaric sent the image of his god abroad in
a wagon, and burnt the houses of all who refused to bow down and
sacrifice<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>. Such lustrations continue to be a prominent feature
of the folk survivals. They are preserved in a number of processional
customs in all parts of England; in the municipal ‘ridings,’ ‘shows,’
or ‘watches’ on St. George’s<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
    or Midsummer<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span> days; in the
‘Godiva’ procession at Coventry<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>, the ‘Bezant’ procession at
Shaftesbury<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>. Hardly a rural merry-making or wake, indeed, is
without its procession; if it is only in the simple form of the
<i>quête</i> which the children consider themselves entitled to
make, with their May-garland, or on some other traditional pretext,
at various seasons of the calendar. Obviously in becoming mere
<i>quêtes</i>, collections of eggs, cakes and so forth, or even of
small coins, as well as in falling entirely into the hands of the
children, the processions have to some extent lost their original
character. But the notion that the visit is to bring good fortune, or
the ‘May’ or the ‘summer’ to the household, is not wholly forgotten in
the rhymes used<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>. An interesting version of the ceremony is the
‘furry’ or ‘faddy’ dance formerly used at Helston wake; for in this the
oak-decked dancers claimed the right to pass in at one door and out at
another through every house in the village<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>.</p>

<p>Room has been found for the summer lustrations in the scheme of the
Church. In Catholic countries the statue of the local saint is commonly
carried round the village, either annually on his feast-day or in times
of exceptional trouble<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>. The inter-relations of ecclesiastical
and folk-ritual in this respect are singularly illustrated by the
celebration of St. Ubaldo’s eve (May 15) at Gubbio in Umbria. The folk
procession of the <i>Ceri</i> is a very complete variety of the summer
festival. After vespers the clergy also hold a procession in honour of
the saint. At a certain point the two companies meet. An interchange of
courtesies takes place. The priest elevates the host; the bearers of
the <i>Ceri</i> bow them to the ground; and each procession passes on
its way<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. In England the summer lustrations take an ecclesiastical
form in the Rogations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span> or ‘bannering’ of ‘Gang-week,’ a ceremony
which itself appears to be based on very similar folk-customs of
southern Europe<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>. Since the Reformation the Rogations have come
to be regarded as little more than a ‘beating of the bounds.’ But the
declared intention of them was originally to call for a blessing upon
the fruits of the earth; and it is not difficult to trace folk-elements
in the ‘gospel oaks’ and ‘gospel wells’ at which station was made and
the gospel read, in the peeled willow wands borne by the boys who
accompany the procession, in the whipping or ‘bumping’ of the said boys
at the stations, and in the choice of ‘Gang-week’ for such agricultural
rites as ‘youling’ and ‘well-dressing<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>.’</p>

<p>Some anthropomorphic representation of the fertilization spirit is a
common, though not an invariable element in the lustration. A doll is
set on the garland, or some popular ‘giant’ or other image is carried
round<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>. Nor is it surprising that at the early spring festival
which survives in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> Plough Monday, the plough itself, the central
instrument of the opening labour, figures. A variant of this custom may
be traced in certain maritime districts, where the functions of the
agricultural deities have been extended to include the oversight of
seafaring. Here it is not a plough but a boat or ship that makes its
rounds, when the fishing season is about to begin. Ship processions are
to be found in various parts of Germany<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>; at Minehead, Plymouth,
and Devonport in the west of England, and probably also at Hull in the
north<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<p>The magical notions which, in part at least, explain the garland
customs of the agricultural festival, are still more strongly at
work in some of its subsidiary rites. These declare themselves, when
understood, to be of an essentially practical character, charms
designed to influence the weather, and to secure the proper alternation
of moisture and warmth which is needed alike for the growth and
ripening of the crops and for the welfare of the cattle. They are
probably even older than the garland-customs, for they do not imply
the animistic conception of a fertilization spirit immanent in leaf
and blossom; and they depend not only upon the ‘sympathetic’ principle
of influence by direct contact already illustrated, but also upon that
other principle of similarity distinguished by Dr. Frazer as the basis
of what he calls ‘mimetic’ magic. To the primitive mind the obvious
way of obtaining a result in nature is to make an imitation of it
on a small scale. To achieve rain, water must be splashed about, or
some other characteristic of a storm or shower must be reproduced. To
achieve sunshine, a fire must be lit, or some other representation of
the appearance and motion of the sun must be devised. Both rain-charms
and sun-charms are very clearly recognizable in the village ritual.</p>

<p>As rain-charms, conscious or unconscious, must be classified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> the many
festival customs in which bathing or sprinkling holds an important
place. The image or bough which represents the fertilization spirit
is solemnly dipped in or drenched with water. Here is the explanation
of the ceremonial bathing of the goddess Nerthus recorded by Tacitus.
It has its parallels in the dipping of the images of saints in the
feast-day processions of many Catholic villages, and in the buckets
of water sometimes thrown over May-pole or harvest-May. Nor is the
dipping or drenching confined to the fertilization spirit. In order
that the beneficent influences of the rite may be spread widely abroad,
water is thrown on the fields and on the plough, while the worshippers
themselves, or a representative chosen from among them, are sprinkled
or immersed. To this practice many survivals bear evidence; the virtues
persistently ascribed to dew gathered on May morning, the ceremonial
bathing of women annually or in times of drought with the expressed
purpose of bringing fruitfulness on man or beast or crop, the ‘ducking’
customs which play no inconsiderable part in the traditions of many a
rural merry-making. Naturally enough, the original sense of the rite
has been generally perverted. The ‘ducking’ has become either mere
horse-play or else a rough-and-ready form of punishment for offences,
real or imaginary, against the rustic code of conduct. The churl who
will not stop working or will not wear green on the feast-day must
be ‘ducked,’ and under the form of the ‘cucking-stool,’ the ceremony
has almost worked its way into formal jurisprudence as an appropriate
treatment for feminine offenders. So, too, it has been with the
‘ducking’ of the divinity. When the modern French peasant throws the
image of his saint into the water, he believes himself to be doing it,
not as a mimetic rain-charm, but as a punishment to compel a power
obdurate to prayer to grant through fear the required boon.</p>

<p>The rain-charms took place, doubtless, at such wells, springs, or
brooks as the lustral procession passed in its progress round the
village. It is also possible that there may have been, sometimes or
always, a well within the sacred grove itself and hard by the sacred
tree. The sanctity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span> derived by such wells and streams from the use of
them in the cult of the fertilization spirit is probably what is really
intended by the water-worship so often ascribed to the heathen of
western Europe, and coupled closely with tree-worship in the Christian
discipline-books. The goddess of the tree was also the goddess of the
well. At the conversion her wells were taken over by the new religion.
They became holy wells, under the protection of the Virgin or one of
the saints. And they continued to be approached with the same rites as
of old, for the purpose of obtaining the ancient boons for which the
fertilization spirit had always been invoked. It will not be forgotten
that, besides the public cult of the fertilization spirit for the
welfare of the crops and herds, there was also a private cult, which
aimed at such more personal objects of desire as health, success in
love and marriage, and divination of the future. It is this private
cult that is most markedly preserved in modern holy well customs.
These may be briefly summarized as follows<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. The wells are sought
for procuring a husband or children, for healing diseases, especially
eye-ailments or warts, and for omens, these too most often in relation
to wedlock. The worshipper bathes wholly or in part, or drinks the
water. Silence is often enjoined, or a motion <i>deasil</i>, that is,
with the sun’s course, round the well. Occasionally cakes are eaten, or
sugar and water drunk, or the well-water is splashed on a stone. Very
commonly rags or bits of wool or hair are laid under a pebble or hung
on a bush near the well, or pins, more rarely coins or even articles of
food, are thrown into it. The objects so left are not probably to be
regarded as offerings; the intention is rather to bring the worshipper,
through the medium of his hair or clothes, or some object belonging to
him, into direct contact with the divinity. The close connexion between
tree-and well-cult is shown by the use of the neighbouring bush on
which to hang the rags. And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> practice of dropping pins into the
well is almost exactly paralleled by that of driving nails ‘for luck’
into a sacred tree or its later representative, a cross or saintly
image. The theory may be hazarded that originally the sacred well was
never found without the sacred tree beside it. This is by no means the
case now; but it must be remembered that a tree is much more perishable
than a well. The tree once gone, its part in the ceremony would drop
out, or be transferred to the well. But the original rite would include
them both. The visitant, for instance, would dip in the well, and then
creep under or through the tree, a double ritual which seems to survive
in the most curious of all the dramatic games of children, ‘Draw a Pail
of Water<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>.’</p>

<p>The private cult of the fertilization spirit is not, of course, tied
to fixed seasons. Its occasion is determined by the needs of the
worshipper. But it is noteworthy that the efficacy of some holy wells
is greatest on particular days, such as Easter or the first three
Sundays in May. And in many places the wells, whether ordinarily
held ‘holy’ or not, take an important place in the ceremonies of the
village festival. The ‘gospel wells’ of the Rogation processions, and
the well to which the ‘Bezant’ procession goes at Shaftesbury are
cases in point; while in Derbyshire the ‘well-dressings’ correspond
to the ‘wakes,’ ‘rushbearings,’ and ‘Mayings’ of other districts.
Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday, as well as the Rogation days, are in a
measure Christian versions of the heathen agricultural feasts, and it
is not, therefore, surprising to find an extensive use of holy water in
ecclesiastical ritual, and a special rite of <i>Benedictio Fontium</i>
included amongst the Easter ceremonies<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>. But the Christian custom
has been moralized, and its avowed aim is purification rather than
prosperity.</p>

<p>The ordinary form of heat-charm was to build, in semblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span> of the sun,
the source of heat, a great fire<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. Just as in the rain-charm the
worshippers must be literally sprinkled with water, so, in order that
they may receive the full benefits of the heat-charm, they must come
into direct physical contact with the fire, by standing in the smoke,
or even leaping through the flames, or by smearing their faces with the
charred ashes<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>. The cattle too must be driven through the fire, in
order that they may be fertile and free from pestilence throughout the
summer; and a whole series of observances had for their especial object
the distribution of the preserving influence over the farms. The fires
were built on high ground, that they might be visible far and wide. Or
they were built in a circle round the fields, or to windward, so that
the smoke might blow across the corn. Blazing arrows were shot in the
air, or blazing torches carried about. Ashes were sprinkled over the
fields, or mingled with the seed corn or the fodder in the stall<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>.
Charred brands were buried or stuck upright in the furrows. Further, by
a simple symbolism, the shape and motion of the sun were mimicked with
circular rotating bodies. A fiery barrel or a fiery wheel was rolled
down the hill on the top of which the ceremony took place. The lighted
torches were whirled in the air, or replaced by lighted disks of wood,
flung on high. All these customs still linger in these islands or in
other parts of western Europe, and often the popular imagination finds
in their successful performance an omen for the fertility of the year.</p>

<p>On <i>a priori</i> grounds one might have expected two agricultural
festivals during the summer; one in the earlier part of it, when
moisture was all-important, accompanied with rain-charms; the other
later on, when the crops were well grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> and heat was required to
ripen them, accompanied with sun-charms. But the evidence is rather in
favour of a single original festival determined, in the dislocation
caused by a calendar, to different dates in different localities<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>.
The Midsummer or St. John’s fires are perhaps the most widely spread
and best known of surviving heat-charms. But they can be paralleled
by others distributed all over the summer cycle of festivals, at
Easter<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and on May-day, and in connexion with the ploughing
celebrations on Epiphany, Candlemas, Shrovetide, Quadragesima, and
St. Blaize’s day. It is indeed at Easter and Candlemas that the
<i>Benedictiones</i>, which are the ecclesiastical versions of
the ceremony, appear in the ritual-books<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>. On the other hand,
although, perhaps owing to the later notion of the solstice, the
fires are greatly prominent on St. John’s day, and are explained
with considerable ingenuity by the monkish writers<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>, yet this
day was never a fire-festival and nothing else. Garland customs are
common upon it, and there is even evidence, though slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> evidence,
for rain-charms<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. It is perhaps justifiable to infer that the
crystallization of the rain-and heat-charms, which doubtless were
originally used only when the actual condition of the weather made them
necessary, into annual festivals, took place after the exact rationale
of them had been lost, and they had both come to be looked upon, rather
vaguely, as weather-charms.</p>

<p>Apart from the festival-fires, a superstitious use of sun-charms
endured in England to an extraordinarily late date. This was in times
of drought and pestilence as a magical remedy against mortality amongst
the cattle. A fire was built, and, as on the festivals, the cattle were
made to pass through the smoke and flames<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>. On such occasions, and
often at the festival-fires themselves, it was held requisite that,
just as the water used in the rain-charms would be fresh water from
the spring, so the fire must be fresh fire. That is to say, it must
not be lit from any pre-existing fire, but must be made anew. And, so
conservative is cult, this must be done, not with the modern device
of matches, or even with flint and steel, but by the primitive method
of causing friction in dry work. Such fire is known as ‘need-fire’ or
‘forced fire,’ and is produced in various ways, by rubbing two pieces
of wood together, by turning a drill in a solid block, or by rapidly
rotating a wheel upon an axle. Often certain precautions are observed,
as that nine men must work at the job, or chaste boys; and often all
the hearth-fires in the village are first extinguished, to be rekindled
by the new flame<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>.</p>

<p>The custom of rolling a burning wheel downhill from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span> festival-fire
amongst the vineyards has been noted. The wheel is, of course, by
no means an uncommon solar emblem<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. Sometimes round bannocks or
hard-boiled eggs are similarly rolled downhill. The use of both of
these may be sacrificial in its nature. But the egg plays such a large
part in festival customs, especially at Easter, when it is reddened,
or gilt, or coloured yellow with furze or broom flowers, and popularly
regarded as a symbol of the Resurrection, that one is tempted to ask
whether it does not stand for the sun itself<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>. And are we to find
the sun in the ‘parish top<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>,’ or in the ball with which, even in
cathedrals, ceremonial games were played<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span> If so, perhaps this
game of ball may be connected with the curious belief that if you get
up early enough on Easter morning you may see the sun dance<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.</p>

<p>In any case sun-charms, quite independent of the fires, may probably
be traced in the circular movements which so often appear invested
with a religious significance, and which sometimes form part of the
festivals<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>. It would be rash to regard such movements as the basis
of every circular dance or <i>ronde</i> on such an occasion; a ring is
too obviously the form which a crowd of spectators round any object,
sacred or otherwise, must take. But there are many circumambulatory
rites in which stress is laid on the necessity for the motion to be
<i>deasil</i>, or with the right hand to the centre, in accordance
with the course of the sun, and not in the opposite direction,
<i>cartuaitheail</i> or <i>withershins</i><a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. And these, perhaps,
may be legitimately considered as of magical origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>With the growth of animistic or spiritual religion, the mental
tendencies, out of which magical practices or charms arise, gradually
cease to be operative in the consciousness of the worshippers. The
charms themselves, however, are preserved by the conservative instinct
of cult. In part they survive as mere bits of traditional ritual, for
which no particular reason is given or demanded; in part also they
become material for that other instinct, itself no less inveterate
in the human mind, by which the relics of the past are constantly in
process of being re-explained and brought into new relations with
the present. The sprinkling with holy water, for instance, which was
originally of the nature of a rain-charm, comes to be regarded as a
rite symbolical of spiritual purification and regeneration. An even
more striking example of such transformation of intention is to be
found in the practice, hardly yet referred to in this account of the
agricultural festivals, of sacrifice. In the ordinary acceptation
of the term, sacrifice implies not merely an animistic, but an
anthropomorphic conception of the object of cult. The offering or
oblation with which man approaches his god is an extension of the
gift with which, as suppliant, he approaches his fellow men. But the
oblational aspect of sacrifice is not the only one. In his remarkable
book upon <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>, Professor Robertson Smith
has formulated another, which may be distinguished as ‘sacramental.’
In this the sacrifice is regarded as the renewal of a special tie
between the god and his worshippers, analogous to the blood-bond which
exists amongst those worshippers themselves. The victim is not an
offering made to the god; on the contrary, the god himself is, or is
present in, the victim. It is his blood which is shed, and by means
of the sacrificial banquet and its subsidiary rites, his personality
becomes, as it were, incorporated in those of his clansmen<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>. It is
not necessary to determine here the general priority of the two types
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span> conceptions of sacrifice described. But, while it is probable that
the Kelts and Teutons of the time of the conversion consciously looked
upon sacrifice as an oblation, there is also reason to believe that, at
an earlier period, the notion of a sacrament had been the predominant
one. For the sacrificial ritual of these peoples, and especially that
used in the agricultural cult, so far as it can be traced, is only
explicable as an elaborate process of just that physical incorporation
of the deity in the worshippers and their belongings, which it was
the precise object of the sacramental sacrifice to bring about. It
will be clear that sacrifice, so regarded, enters precisely into that
category of ideas which has been defined as magical. It is but one more
example of that belief in the efficacy of direct contact which lies at
the root of sympathetic magic. As in the case of the garland customs,
this belief, originally pre-animistic, has endured into an animistic
stage of thought. Through the garland and the posies the worshipper
sought contact with the fertilization spirit in its phytomorphic form;
through sacrifice he approaches it in its theriomorphic form also.
The earliest sacrificial animals, then, were themselves regarded as
divine, and were naturally enough the food animals of the folk. The use
made by the Kelto-Teutonic peoples of oxen, sheep, goats, swine, deer,
geese, and fowls requires no explanation. A common victim was also
the horse, which the Germans seem, up to a late date, to have kept in
droves and used for food. The strong opposition of the Church to the
sacrificial use of horse-flesh may possibly account for the prejudice
against it as a food-stuff in modern Europe<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. A similar prejudice,
however, in the case of the hare, an animal of great importance in folk
belief, already existed in the time of Caesar<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>. It is a little more
puzzling to find distinct traces of sacrificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span> customs in connexion
with animals, such as the dog, cat, wolf, fox, squirrel, owl, wren,
and so forth, which are not now food animals<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. But they may once
have been such, or the explanation may lie in an extension of the
sacrificial practice after the first rationale of it was lost.</p>

<p>At every agricultural festival, then, animal sacrifice may be assumed
as an element. The analogy of the relation between the fertilization
spirit and his worshippers to the human blood bond makes it probable
that originally the rite was always a bloody one<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>. Some of
the blood was poured on the sacred tree. Some was sprinkled upon
the worshippers, or smeared over their faces, or solemnly drunk
by them<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. Hides, horns, and entrails were also hung upon the
tree<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>, or worn as festival trappings<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>. The flesh was, of
course, solemnly eaten in the sacrificial meal<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. The crops, as
well as their cultivators, must benefit by the rites; and therefore
the fields, and doubtless also the cattle, had their sprinkling of
blood, while heads or pieces of flesh were buried in the furrows, or at
the threshold of the byre<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>. A fair notion of the whole proceeding
may be obtained from the account of the similar Indian worship of the
earth-goddess given in Appendix I. The intention of the ceremonies will
be obvious by a comparison with those already explained. The wearing
of the skins of the victims is precisely parallel to the wearing of
the green vegetation, the sprinkling with blood to the sprinkling
with lustral water, the burial in the fields of flesh and skulls to
the burial of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> brands from the festival-fire. In each case the belief
in the necessity of direct physical contact to convey the beneficent
influence is at the bottom of the practice. It need hardly be said
that of such physical contact the most complete example is in the
sacramental banquet itself.</p>

<p>It is entirely consistent with the view here taken of the primitive
nature of sacrifice, that the fertilization spirit was sacrificed at
the village festivals in its vegetable as well as in its animal form.
There were bread-offerings as well as meat-offerings<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. Sacramental
cakes were prepared with curious rituals which attest their primitive
character. Like the <i>tcharnican</i> or Beltane cakes, they were
kneaded and moulded by hand and not upon a board<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>; like the loaf
in the Anglo-Saxon charm, they were compounded of all sorts of grain
in order that they might be representative of every crop in the
field<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. At the harvest they would naturally be made, wholly or in
part, of the last sheaf cut. The use of them corresponded closely to
that made of the flesh of the sacrificial victim. Some were laid on
a branch of the sacred tree<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>; others flung into the sacred well
or the festival-fire; others again buried in the furrows, or crumbled
up and mingled with the seed-corn<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>. And like the flesh they were
solemnly eaten by the worshippers themselves at the sacrificial
banquet. With the sacrificial cake went the sacrificial draught, also
made out of the fruits of the earth, in the southern lands wine, but in
the vineless north ale, or cider, or that mead which Pytheas described
the Britons as brewing out of honey and wheat<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. Of this, too, the
trees and crops received their share, while it filled the cup for
those toasts or <i>minnes</i> to the dead and to Odin and Freyja their
rulers, which were afterwards transferred by Christian Germany to St.
John and St. Gertrude<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.</p>

<p>The animal and the cereal sacrifices seem plausible enough, but they do
not exhaust the problem. One has to face the fact that human sacrifice,
as Victor Hehn puts it, ‘peers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span> uncannily forth from the dark past of
every Aryan race<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>. So far as the Kelts and Teutons go, there is
plenty of evidence to show, that up to the very moment of their contact
with Roman civilization, in some branches even up to the very moment
of their conversion to Christianity, it was not yet obsolete<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.
An explanation of it is therefore required, which shall fall in with
the general theory of agricultural sacrifice. The subject is very
difficult, but, on the whole, it seems probable that originally the
slaying of a human being at an annually recurring festival was not of
the nature of sacrifice at all. It is doubtful whether it was ever
sacrifice in the sacramental sense, and although in time it came to be
regarded as an oblation, this was not until the first meaning, both
of the sacrifice and of the human death, had been lost. The essential
facts bearing on the question have been gathered together by Dr. Frazer
in <i>The Golden Bough</i>. He brings out the point that the victim in
a human sacrifice was not originally merely a man, but a very important
man, none other than the king, the priest-king of the tribe. In many
communities, Aryan-speaking and other, it has been the principal
function of such a priest-king to die, annually or at longer intervals,
for the people. His place is taken, as a rule, by the tribesman who has
slain him<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>. Dr. Frazer’s own explanation of this custom is, that
the head of the tribe was looked upon as possessed of great magical
powers, as a big medicine man, and was in fact identified with the god
himself. And his periodical death, says Dr. Frazer, was necessary,
in order to renew the vitality of the god, who might decay and cease
to exist, were he not from time to time reincarnated by being slain
and passing into the body of his slayer and successor<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>. This is a
highly ingenious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> and fascinating theory, but unfortunately there are
several difficulties in the way of accepting it. In the first place
it is inconsistent with the explanation of the sacramental killing of
the god arrived at by Professor Robertson Smith. According to this
the sacrifice of the god is for the sake of his worshippers, that the
blood-bond with them may be renewed; and we have seen that this view
fits in admirably with the minor sacrificial rites, such as the eating
and burying of the flesh, as the wearing of the horns and hides. Dr.
Frazer, however, obliges us to hold that the god is also sacrificed
for his own sake, and leaves us in the position of propounding two
quite distinct and independent reasons for the same fact. Secondly,
there is no evidence, at least amongst Aryan-speaking peoples, for that
breaking down of the very real and obvious distinction between the god
and his chief worshipper or priest, which Dr. Frazer’s theory implies.
And thirdly, if the human victim were slain as being the god, surely
this slaughter should have replaced the slaughter of the animal victim
previously slain for the same reason, which it did not, and should have
been followed by a sacramental meal of a cannibal type, of which also,
in western Europe, there is but the slightest trace<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.</p>

<p>Probably, therefore, the alternative explanation of Dr. Frazer’s own
facts given by Dr. Jevons is preferable. According to this the death
of the human victim arises out of the circumstances of the animal
sacrifice. The slaying of the divine animal is an act approached by the
tribe with mingled feelings. It is necessary, in order to renew the
all-essential blood-bond between the god and his worshippers. And at
the same time it is an act of sacrilege; it is killing the god. There
is some hesitation amongst the assembled worshippers. Who will dare the
deed and face its consequences? ‘The clansman,’ says Dr. Jevons, ‘whose
religious conviction of the clan’s need of communion with the god was
deepest, would eventually and after long waiting be the one to strike,
and take upon himself the issue, for the sake of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span> his fellow men.’ This
issue would be twofold. The slayer would be exalted in the eyes of
his fellows. He would naturally be the first to drink the shed blood
of the god. A double portion of the divine spirit would enter into
him. He would become, for a while, the leader, the priest-king, of the
community. At the same time he would incur blood-guiltiness. And in a
year’s time, when his sanctity was exhausted, the penalty would have to
be paid. His death would accompany the renewal of the bond by a fresh
sacrifice, implying in its turn the self-devotion of a fresh annual
king<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.</p>

<p>These theories belong to a region of somewhat shadowy conjecture. If
Dr. Jevons is right, it would seem to follow that, as has already been
suggested, the human death at an annual festival was not initially
sacrifice. It accompanied, but did not replace the sacramental
slaughter of a divine animal. But when the animal sacrifice had itself
changed its character, and was looked upon, no longer as an act of
communion with the god, but as an offering or bribe made to him,
then a new conception of the human death also was required. When the
animal ceased to be recognized as the god, the need of a punishment
for slaying it disappeared. But the human death could not be left
meaningless, and its meaning was assimilated to that of the animal
sacrifice itself. It also became an oblation, the greatest that could
be offered by the tribe to its protector and its judge. And no doubt
this was the conscious view taken of the matter by Kelts and Teutons at
the time when they appear in history. The human sacrifice was on the
same footing as the animal sacrifice, but it was a more binding, a more
potent, a more solemn appeal.</p>

<p>In whatever way human sacrifice originated, it was obviously destined,
with the advance of civilization, to undergo modification. Not only
would the growing moral sense of mankind learn to hold it a dark and
terrible thing, but also to go on killing the leading man of the tribe,
the king-priest, would have its obvious practical inconveniences. At
first, indeed, these would not be great. The king-priest would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
little more than a rain-maker, a <i>rex sacrorum</i>, and one man might
perform the ceremonial observances as well as another. But as time went
on, and the tribe settled down to a comparatively civilized life, the
serious functions of its leader would increase. He would become the
arbiter of justice, the adviser in debate; above all, when war grew
into importance, the captain in battle. And to spare and replace, year
by year, the wisest councillor and the bravest warrior would grow into
an intolerable burden. Under some such circumstances, one can hardly
doubt, a process of substitution set in. Somebody had to die for the
king. At first, perhaps, the substitute was an inferior member of the
king’s own house, or even an ordinary tribesman, chosen by lot. But
the process, once begun, was sure to continue, and presently it was
sufficient if a life of little value, that of a prisoner, a slave,
a criminal, a stranger within the gates, was sacrificed<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>. The
common belief in madness or imbecility as a sign of divine possession
may perhaps have contributed to make the village fool or natural
seem a particularly suitable victim. But to the very end of Teutonic
and Keltic heathenism, the sense that the substitute was, after all,
only a substitute can be traced. In times of great stress or danger,
indeed, the king might still be called upon to suffer in person<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.
And always a certain pretence that the victim was the king was kept
up. Even though a slave or criminal, he was for a few days preceding
the sacrifice treated royally. He was a temporary king, was richly
dressed and feasted, had a crown set on his head, and was permitted to
hold revel with his fellows. The farce was played out in the sight of
men and gods<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. Ultimately, of course, the natural growth of the
sanctity of human life in a progressive people, or in an unprogressive
people the pressure of outside ideals<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>, forbids the sacrifice of
a man at all. Perhaps the temporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span> king is still chosen, and even
some symbolic mimicked slaying of him takes place; but actually he does
not die. An animal takes his place upon the altar; or more strictly
speaking, an animal remains the last victim, as it had been the first,
and in myth is regarded as a substitute for the human victim which for
a time had shared its fate. Of such a myth the legends of Abraham and
Isaac and of Iphigeneia at Aulis are the classical examples.</p>

<p>There is another group of myths for which, although they lack this
element of a substituted victim, mythologists find an origin in
a reformation of religious sentiment leading to the abolition of
human sacrifice. The classical legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the
hagiological legend of St. George and the Dragon, the Teutonic legend
of Beowulf and Grendel, are only types of innumerable tales in which
the hero puts an end to the periodical death of a victim by slaying
the monster who has enforced and profited by it<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>. What is such a
story but the imaginative statement of the fact that such sacrifices
at one time were, and are not? It is, however, noticeable, that in the
majority of these stories, although not in all, the dragon or monster
slain has his dwelling in water, and this leads to the consideration
of yet another sophistication of the primitive notion of sacrifice.
According to this notion sacrifice was necessarily bloody; in the
shedding of blood and in the sacrament of blood partaken of by the
worshippers, lay the whole gist of the rite: a bloodless sacrifice
would have no <i>raison d’être</i>. On the other hand, the myths just
referred to seem to imply a bloodless sacrifice by drowning, and this
notion is confirmed by an occasional bit of ritual, and by the common
superstition which represents the spirits of certain lakes and rivers
as claiming a periodical victim in the shape of a drowned person<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>.
Similarly there are traces of sacrifices, which must have been equally
bloodless, by fire. At the Beltane festival, for instance, one member
of the party is chosen by lot to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span> the ‘victim,’ is made to jump
over the flames and is spoken of in jest as ‘dead<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>.’ Various Roman
writers, who apparently draw from the second-century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Greek explorer Posidonius, ascribe to the Druids of Gaul a custom of
burning human and other victims at quinquennial feasts in colossal
images of hollow wickerwork; and squirrels, cats, snakes and other
creatures are frequently burnt in modern festival-fires<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. The
constant practice, indeed, of burning bones in such fires has given
them the specific name of bonfires, and it may be taken for granted
that the bones are only representatives of more complete victims.
I would suggest that such sacrifices by water and fire are really
developments of the water-and fire-charms described in the last
chapter; and that just as the original notion of sacrifice has been
extended to give a new significance to the death of a human being at
a religious festival, when the real reason for that death had been
forgotten, so it has been still further extended to cover the primitive
water-and fire-charms when they too had become meaningless. I mean that
at a festival the victims, like the image and the worshippers, were
doubtless habitually flung into water or passed through fire as part
of the charm; and that, at a time when sacrifice had grown into mere
oblation and the shedding of blood was therefore no longer essential,
these rites were adapted and given new life as alternative methods of
effecting the sacrifice.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that there should be but few direct and evident
survivals of sacrifice in English village custom. For at the time
of the conversion the rite must have borne the whole brunt of the
missionary attack. The other elements of the festivals, the sacred
garlands, the water-and fire-charms, had already lost much of their
original significance. A judgement predisposed to toleration might
plausibly look upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> them as custom rather than worship. It was
not so with sacrifice. This too had had its history, and in divers
ways changed its character. But it was still essentially a liturgy.
Oblation or sacrament, it could not possibly be dissociated from a
recognition of the divine nature of the power in whose honour it took
place. And therefore it must necessarily be renounced, as a condition
of acceptance in the Church at all, by the most weak-kneed convert.
What happened was precisely that to which Gregory the Great looked
forward. The sacrificial banquet, the great chines of flesh, and the
beakers of ale, cider, and mead, endured, but the central rite of
the old festival, the ceremonial slaying of the animal, vanished.
The exceptions, however, are not so rare as might at first sight be
thought, and naturally they are of singular interest. It has already
been pointed out that in times of stress and trouble, the thinly
veneered heathenism of the country folk long tended to break out, and
in particular that up to a very late date the primitive need-fire was
occasionally revived to meet the exigencies of a cattle-plague. Under
precisely similar circumstances, and sometimes in immediate connexion
with the need-fire, cattle have been known, even during the present
century, to be sacrificed<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. Nor are such sporadic instances the
only ones that can be adduced. Here and there sacrifice, in a more or
less modified form, remains an incident in the village festival. The
alleged custom of annually sacrificing a sheep on May-day at Andreas
in the Isle of Man rests on slight evidence<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>; but there is a
fairly well authenticated example in the ‘ram feast’ formerly held on
the same day in the village of Holne in Devonshire. A ram was slain
at a granite pillar or ancient altar in the village ‘ploy-field,’
and a struggle took place for slices which were supposed to bring
luck<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> Still more degenerate survivals are afforded by the
Whitsun feast at King’s Teignton, also in Devonshire<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>, and by the
Whitsun ‘lamb feast’ at Kidlington<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>, the Trinity ‘lamb ale’ at
Kirtlington<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>, and the ‘Whit hunt’ in Wychwood Forest<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>, all
three places lying close together in Oxfordshire. These five cases have
been carefully recorded and studied; but they do not stand alone; for
the folk-calendar affords numerous examples of days which are marked,
either universally or locally, by the ceremonial hunting or killing of
some wild or domestic animal, or by the consumption of a particular
dish which readily betrays its sacrificial origin<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>. The appearance
of animals in ecclesiastical processions in St. Paul’s cathedral<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
and at Bury St. Edmunds<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> is especially significant; and it is
natural to find an origin for the old English sport of bull-baiting
rather in a survival of heathen ritual than in any reminiscence of the
Roman amphitheatre<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. Even where sacrifice itself has vanished, the
minor rites which once accompanied it are still perpetuated in the
superstitions or the festival customs of the peasantry. The heads and
hides of horses or cattle, like the <i>exuviae</i> of the sacrificial
victims, are worn or carried in dance, procession or <i>quête</i><a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>.
The dead bodies of animals are suspended by shepherds or game-keepers
upon tree and barn-door, from immemorial habit or from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> some vague
suspicion of the luck they will bring. Although inquiry will perhaps
elicit the fallacious explanation that they are there <i>pour
encourager les autres</i><a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>. In the following chapters an attempt
will be made to show how widely sacrifice is represented in popular
amusements and <i>ludi</i>. Here it will be sufficient to call
attention to two personages who figure largely in innumerable village
festivals. One is the ‘hobby-horse,’ not yet, though Shakespeare will
have it so, ‘forgot<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>’: the other the ‘fool’ or ‘squire,’ a buffoon
with a pendent cow’s tail, who is in many places <i>de rigueur</i> in
Maying or rushbearing<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>. Both of these grotesques seem to be at
bottom nothing but worshippers careering in the skins of sacrificed
animals.</p>

<p>The cereal or liquor sacrifice is of less importance. Sugar and
water, which may be conjectured to represent mead, is occasionally
drunk beside a sacred well, and in one instance, at least, bread and
cheese are thrown into the depths. Sometimes also a ploughman carries
bread and cheese in his pocket when he goes abroad to cut the first
furrow<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. But the original rite is probably most nearly preserved in
the custom of ‘youling’ fruit-trees to secure a good crop. When this
is done, at Christmas or Ascension-tide, ale or cider is poured on the
roots of the trees, and a cake placed in a fork of the boughs. Here
and there a cake is also hung on the horn of an ox in the stall<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>.
Doubtless the ‘feasten’ cake, of traditional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> shape and composition,
which pervades the country, is in its origin sacramental<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>. Commonly
enough, it represents an animal or human being, and in such cases it
may be held, while retaining its own character of a cereal sacrifice,
to be also a substitute for the animal or human sacrifice with which it
should by rights be associated<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>.</p>

<p>An unauthenticated and somewhat incredible story has been brought from
Italy to the effect that the mountaineers of the Abruzzi are still
in the habit of offering up a human sacrifice in Holy week<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>. In
these islands a reminiscence of the observance is preserved in the
‘victim’ of the Beltane festival<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>, and a transformation of it in
the whipping of lads when the bounds are beaten in the Rogations<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.
Some others, less obvious, will be suggested in the sequel. In any case
one ceremony which, as has been seen, grew out of human sacrifice, has
proved remarkably enduring. This is the election of the temporary king.
Originally chosen out of the lowest of the people for death, and fêted
as the equivalent or double of the real king-priest of the community,
he has survived the tragic event which gave him birth, and plays a
great part as the master of the ceremonies in many a village revel.
The English ‘May-king,’ or ‘summer-king,’ or ‘harvest-lord<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>,’ or
‘mock-mayor<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>,’ is a very familiar personage, and can be even more
abundantly paralleled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> from continental festivals<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>. To the May-king
in particular we shall return. But in concluding this chapter it is
worth while to point out and account for two variants of the custom
under consideration. In many cases, probably in the majority of cases
so far as the English May-day is concerned, the king is not a king,
but a queen. Often, indeed, the part is played by a lad in woman’s
clothes, but this seems only to emphasize the fact that the temporary
ruler is traditionally regarded as a female one<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>. It is probable
that we have here no modern development, but a primitive element
in the agricultural worship. Tacitus records the presence amongst
the Germans of a male priest ‘adorned as women use<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>,’ while the
exchange of garments by the sexes is included amongst festival abuses
in the ecclesiastical discipline-books<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. Occasionally, moreover,
the agricultural festivals, like those of the <i>Bona Dea</i> at Rome,
are strictly feminine functions, from which all men are excluded<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.
Naturally I regard these facts as supporting my view of the origin of
the agricultural worship in a women’s cult, upon which the pastoral
cult of the men was afterwards engrafted. And finally, there are cases
in which not a king alone nor a queen alone is found, but a king and a
queen<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. This also would be a reasonable outcome of the merging of
the two cults. Some districts know the May-queen as the May-bride, and
it is possible that a symbolical wedding of a priest and priestess may
have been one of the regular rites of the summer festivals. For this
there seem to be some parallels in Greek and Roman custom, while the
myth which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> represents the heaven as the fertilizing husband of the
fruitful earth is of hoar antiquity amongst the Aryan-speaking peoples.
The forces which make for the fertility of the fields were certainly
identified in worship with those which make for human fertility. The
waters of the sacred well or the blaze of the festival fire help the
growth of the crops; they also help women in their desire for a lover
and for motherhood. And it may be taken for granted that the summer
festivals knew from the beginning that element of sexual licence
which fourteen centuries of Christianity have not wholly been able to
banish<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—A systematic revision of J.
Strutt, <i>The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</i>
(1801, ed. W. Hone, 1830), is, as in the case of Brand’s book,
much needed. On the psychology of play should be consulted K.
Groos, <i>Die Spiele der Thiere</i> (1896, transl. 1898), and
<i>Die Spiele der Menschen</i> (1899, transl. 1901). Various

<p>The charms, the prayer, the sacrifice, make up that side of the
agricultural festival which may properly be regarded as cult: they do
not make up the whole of it. It is natural to ask whether, side by side
with the observances of a natural religion, there were any of a more
spiritual type; whether the village gods of our Keltic and Teutonic
ancestors were approached on festival occasions solely as the givers of
the good things of earth, or whether there was also any recognition of
the higher character which in time they came to have as the guardians
of morality, such as we can trace alike in the ritual of Eleusis and
in the tribal mysteries of some existing savage peoples. It is not
improbable that this was so; but it may be doubted whether there is
much available evidence on the matter, and, in any case, it cannot be
gone into here<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>. There is, however, a third element of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> the village
festival which does demand consideration, and that is the element
of play. The day of sacrifice was also a day of cessation from the
ordinary toil of the fields, a holiday as well as a holy day. Sacred
and secular met in the amorous encounters smiled upon by the liberal
wood-goddess, and in the sacramental banquet with its collops of flesh
and spilth of ale and mead. But the experience of any bank holiday
will show that, for those who labour, the suspension of their ordinary
avocations does not mean quiescence. When the blood is heated with love
and liquor, the nervous energies habitually devoted to wielding the
goad and guiding the plough must find vent in new and for the nonce
unprofitable activities. But such activities, self-sufficing, and
primarily at least serving no end beyond themselves, are, from pushpin
to poetry, exactly what is meant by play<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.</p>

<p>The instinct of play found a foothold at the village feast in the
débris which ritual, in its gradual transformation, left behind. It has
already been noted as a constant feature in the history of institutions
that a survival does not always remain merely a survival; it may be its
destiny, when it is emptied of its first significance, to be taken up
into a different order of ideas, and to receive a new lease of vitality
under a fresh interpretation. Sacrifice ceases to be sacrament and
becomes oblation. Dipping and smoking customs, originally magical, grow
to be regarded as modes of sacrificial death. Other such waifs of the
past become the inheritance of play. As the old conception of sacrifice
passed into the new one, the subsidiary rites, through which the
sacramental influence had of old been distributed over the worshippers
and their fields, although by no means disused, lost their primitive
meaning. Similarly, when human sacrifice was abolished, that too left
traces of itself, only imperfectly intelligible, in mock or symbolical
deaths, or in the election of the temporary king. Thus, even before
Christianity antiquated the whole structure of the village festivals,
there were individual practices kept alive only by the conservatism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
tradition, and available as material for the play instinct. These find
room in the festivals side by side with other customs which the same
instinct not only preserved but initiated. Of course, the antithesis
between play and cult must not be pushed too far. The peasant mind is
tenacious of acts and forgetful of explanations; and the chapters to
come will afford examples of practices which, though they began in
play, came in time to have a serious significance of quasi-ritual, and
to share in the popular imagination the prestige as fertility charms of
the older ceremonies of worship with which they were associated. The
<i>ludi</i> to be immediately discussed, however, present themselves
in the main as sheer play. Several of them have broken loose from the
festivals altogether, or, if they still acknowledge their origin by
making a special appearance on some fixed day, are also at the service
of ordinary amusement, whenever the leisure or the whim of youth may so
suggest.</p>

<p>To begin with, it is possible that athletic sports and horse-racing are
largely an outcome of sacrificial festivals. Like the Greeks around
the pyre of Patroclus, the Teutons celebrated games at the tombs of
their dead chieftains<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>. But games were a feature of seasonal, no
less than funeral feasts. It will be remembered that the council of
Clovesho took pains to forbid the keeping of the Rogation days with
horse-races. A bit of wrestling or a bout of quarter-staff is still
<i>de rigueur</i> at many a wake or rushbearing, while in parts of
Germany the winner of a race or of a shooting-match at the popinjay is
entitled to light the festival fire, or to hold the desired office of
May-king<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>. The reforming bishops of the thirteenth century include
public wrestling-bouts and contests for prizes amongst the <i>ludi</i>
whose performance they condemn; and they lay particular stress upon a
custom described as <i>arietum super ligna et rotas elevationes</i>.
The object of these ‘ram-raisings’ seems to be explained by the fact
that in the days of Chaucer a ram was the traditional reward proposed
for a successful wrestler<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>; and this perhaps enables us to push
the connexion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> with the sacrificial rite a little further. I would
suggest that the original object of the man who wrestled for a ram, or
climbed a greasy pole for a leg of mutton, or shot for a popinjay, was
to win a sacrificial victim or a capital portion thereof, which buried
in his field might bring him abundant crops. The orderly competition
doubtless evolved itself from such an indiscriminate scrimmage for the
fertilizing fragments as marks the rites of the earth-goddess in the
Indian village feast<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. Tug-of-war would seem to be capable of a
similar explanation, though here the desired object is not a portion
of the victim, but rather a straw rope made out of the corn divinity
itself in the form of the harvest-May<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. An even closer analogy
with the Indian rite is afforded by such games as hockey and football.
The ball is nothing else than the head of the sacrificial beast, and
it is the endeavour of each player to get it into his own possession,
or, if sides are taken, to get it over a particular boundary<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>.
Originally, of course, this was the player’s own boundary; it has come
to be regarded as that of his opponents; but this inversion of the
point of view is not one on which much stress can be laid. In proof
of this theory it may be pointed out that in many places football is
still played, traditionally, on certain days of the year. The most
notable example is perhaps at Dorking, where the annual Shrove Tuesday
scrimmage in the streets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span> of the town and the annual efforts of the
local authorities to suppress it furnish their regular paragraph to the
newspapers. There are several others, in most of which, as at Dorking,
the contest is between two wards or districts of the town<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. This
feature is repeated in the Shrove Tuesday tug-of-war at Ludlow, and
in annual faction-fights elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. It is probably due to that
συνοικισμός of village communities by which towns often came into
being. Here and there, moreover, there are to be found rude forms of
football in which the primitive character of the proceeding is far more
evident than in the sophisticated game. Two of these deserve especial
mention. At Hallaton in Leicestershire a feast is held on Easter Monday
at a piece of high ground called Hare-pie Bank. A hare—the sacrificial
character of the hare has already been dwelt upon—is carried in
procession. ‘Hare-pies’ are scrambled for; and then follows a sport
known as ‘bottle-kicking.’ Hooped wooden field-bottles are thrown down
and a scrimmage ensues between the men of Hallaton and the men of the
adjoining village of Medbourne. Besides the connexion with the hare
sacrifice, it is noticeable that each party tries to drive the bottle
towards its own boundary, and not that of its opponents<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>. More
interesting still is the Epiphany struggle for the ‘Haxey hood’ at
Haxey in Lincolnshire. The ‘hood’ is a roll of sacking or leather, and
it is the object of each of the players to carry it to a public-house
in his own village. The ceremony is connected with the Plough Monday
<i>quête</i>, and the ‘plough-bullocks’ or ‘boggons’ led by their
‘lord duke’ and their ‘fool,’ known as ‘Billy Buck,’ are the presiding
officials. On the following day a festival-fire is lit, over which
the fool is ‘smoked.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> The strongest support is given to my theory of
the origin of this type of game, by an extraordinary speech which the
fool delivers from the steps of an old cross. As usual, the cross has
taken the place of a more primitive tree or shrine. The speech runs
as follows: ‘Now, good folks, this is Haxa’ Hood. We’ve killed two
bullocks and a half, <i>but the other half we had to leave running
field</i>: we can fetch it if it’s wanted. Remember it’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Hoose agin hoose, toon agin toon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if you meet a man, knock him doon.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this case then, the popular memory has actually preserved the
tradition that the ‘hood’ or ball played with is the half of a bullock,
the head that is to say, of the victim decapitated at a sacrifice<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>.</p>

<p>Hockey and football and tug-of-war are lusty male sports, but the
sacrificial survival recurs in some of the singing games played by
girls and children. The most interesting of these is that known as
‘Oranges and Lemons.’ An arch is formed by two children with raised
hands, and under this the rest of the players pass. Meanwhile rhymes
are sung naming the bells of various parishes, and ending with some
such formula as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Here comes a chopper to chop off your head:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The last, last, last, last man’s head.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the last word is sung, the hands forming the arch are lowered, and
the child who is then passing is caught, and falls in behind one of
the leaders. When all in turn have been so caught, a tug-of-war, only
without a rope, follows. The ‘chopping’ obviously suggests a sacrifice,
in this case a human sacrifice. And the bell-rhymes show the connexion
of the game with the parish contests just described. There exists
indeed a precisely similar set of verses which has the title, <i>Song
of the Bells of Derby on Football Morning</i>. The set ordinarily
used in ‘Oranges and Lemons’ names London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> parishes, but here is a
Northamptonshire variant, which is particularly valuable because it
alludes to another rite of the agricultural festival, the sacramental
cake buried in a furrow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Pancakes and fritters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Says the bells of St. Peter’s:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where must we fry ’em?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Says the bells of Cold Higham:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In yonder land thurrow (furrow)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Says the bells of Wellingborough, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other games of the same type are ‘How many Miles to Babylon,’ ‘Through
the Needle Eye,’ and ‘Tower of London.’ These add an important incident
to ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ in that a ‘king’ is said to be passing through
the arch. On the other hand, some of them omit the tug-of-war<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>.
With all these singing games it is a little difficult to say whether
they proceed from children’s imitations of the more serious proceedings
pf their elders, or whether they were originally played at the
festivals by grown men and maidens, and have gradually, like the May
<i>quête</i> itself, fallen into the children’s hands. The ‘Oranges and
Lemons’ group has its analogy to the tug-of-war; the use of the arch
formation also connects it with the festival ‘country’ dances which
will be mentioned in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The rude punishments by which the far from rigid code of village
ethics vindicates itself against offenders, are on the border line
between play and jurisprudence. These also appear to be in some cases
survivals, diverted from their proper context, of festival usage. It
has been pointed out that the ducking which was a form of rain-charm
came to be used as a penalty for the churlish or dispirited person,
who declined to throw up his work or to wear green on the festival
day. In other places this same person has to ‘ride the stang.’ That
is to say, he is set astride a pole and borne about with contumely,
until he compounds for his misdemeanour by a fine in coin or
liquor<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>. ‘Riding the stang,’ however, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> a rural punishment of
somewhat wide application<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>. It is common to England and to France,
where it can be traced back, under the names of <i>charivari</i>
and <i>chevauchée</i>, to the fifteenth century<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. The French
<i>sociétés joyeuses</i>, which will be described in a later chapter,
made liberal use of it<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. The offences to which it is appropriate
are various. A miser, a henpecked husband or a wife-beater, especially
in May, and, on the other hand, a shrew or an unchaste woman, are
liable to visitation, as are the parties to a second or third marriage,
or to one perilously long delayed, or one linking May to December.
The precise ceremonial varies considerably. Sometimes the victim has
to ride on a pole, sometimes on a hobby-horse<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>, or on an ass with
his face turned to the tail<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>. Sometimes, again, he does not appear
at all, but is represented by an effigy or guy, or, in France, by
his next-door neighbour<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. This dramatic version is, according to
Mr. Barrett, properly called a ‘skimmington riding,’ while the term
‘riding the stang’ is reserved for that in which the offender figures
in person. The din of kettles, bones, and cleavers, so frequent an
element in rustic ceremonies, is found here also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> and in one locality
at least the attendants are accustomed to blacken their faces<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.
It may perhaps be taken for granted that ‘riding the stang’ is an
earlier form of the punishment than the more delicate and symbolical
‘skimmington riding’; and it is probable that the rider represents a
primitive village criminal haled off to become the literal victim at
a sacrificial rite. The fine or forfeit by which in some cases the
offence can be purged seems to create an analogy between the custom
under consideration and other sacrificial survivals which must now be
considered. These are perhaps best treated in connexion with Hock-tide
and the curious play proper to that festival at Coventry<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>. This
play was revived for the entertainment of Elizabeth when she visited
the Earl of Leicester at Kenilworth in July, 1575, and there exists
a description of it in a letter written by one Robert Laneham, who
accompanied the court, to a friend in London<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. The men of Coventry,
led by one Captain Cox, who presented it called it an ‘olld storiall
sheaw,’ with for argument the massacre of the Danes by Ethelred on
Saint Brice’s night 1002<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>. Laneham says that it was ‘expressed
in actionz and rymez,’ and it appears from his account to have been
a kind of sham fight or ‘barriers’ between two parties representing
respectively Danish ‘launsknights’ and English, ‘each with allder poll
marcially in their hand<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>.’ In the end the Danes were defeated and
‘many led captiue for triumph by our English wéemen.’ The presenters
also stated that the play was of ‘an auncient beginning’ and ‘woont
too bee plaid in oour Citee yeárely.’ Of late, however, it had been
‘laid dooun,’ owing to the importunity of their preachers, and ‘they
woold make theyr humbl peticion vntoo her highnes, that they myght
haue theyr playz vp agayn.’ The records of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> Coventry itself add but
little to what Laneham gathered. The local <i>Annals</i>, not a very
trustworthy chronicle, ascribe the invention of ‘Hox Tuesday’ to
1416-7, and perhaps confirm the <i>Letter</i> by noting that in 1575-6
the ‘pageants on Hox Tuesday’ were played after eight years<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>.
We have seen that, according to the statement made at Kenilworth,
the event commemorated by the performance was the Danish massacre
of 1002. There was, however, another tradition, preserved by the
fifteenth-century writer John Rous, which connected it rather with the
sudden death of Hardicanute and the end of the Danish usurpation at
the accession of Edward the Confessor<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>. It is, of course, possible
that local <i>cantilenae</i> on either or both of these events may
have existed, and may have been worked into the ‘rymez’ of the play.
But I think it may be taken for granted that, as in the Lady Godiva
procession, the historical element is comparatively a late one, which
has been grafted upon already existing festival customs. One of these
is perhaps the faction-fight just discussed. But it is to be noticed
that the performance as described by Laneham ended with the Danes being
led away captive by English women; and this episode seems to be clearly
a dramatization of a characteristic Hock-tide <i>ludus</i> found in
many places other than Coventry. On Hock-Monday, the women ‘hocked’
the men; that is to say, they went abroad with ropes, caught and bound
any man they came across, and exacted a forfeit. On Hock-Tuesday, the
men retaliated in similar fashion upon the women. Bishop Carpenter
of Worcester forbade this practice in his diocese in 1450<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>, but
like some other festival customs it came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> to be recognized as a source
of parochial revenue, and the ‘gaderyngs’ at Hock-tide, of which the
women’s was always the most productive, figure in many a churchwarden’s
budget well into the seventeenth century<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. At Shrewsbury in
1549 ‘hocking’ led to a tragedy. Two men were ‘smothered under the
Castle hill,’ hiding themselves from maids, the hill falling there on
them<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>.’ ‘Hockney day’ is still kept at Hungerford, and amongst the
old-fashioned officers elected on this occasion, with the hay-ward and
the ale-tasters, are the two ‘tything men’ or ‘tutti men,’ somewhat
doubtfully said to be so named from their poles wreathed with ‘tutties’
or nose-gays, whose function it is to visit the commoners, and to claim
from every man a coin and from every woman a kiss<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>. The derivation
of the term Hock-tide has given rise to some wild conjectures, and
philologists have failed to come to a conclusion on the subject<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>.
Hock-tide is properly the Monday and Tuesday following the Second
Sunday after Easter, and ‘Hokedaie’ or <i>Quindena Paschae</i> is
a frequent term day in leases and other legal documents from the
thirteenth century onwards<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>.</p>

<p>‘Hocking’ can be closely paralleled from other customs of the spring
festivals. The household books of Edward I record in 1290 a payment
‘to seven ladies of the queen’s chamber who took the king in bed on
the morrow of Easter, and made him fine himself<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>.’ This was the
<i>prisio</i> which at a later date perturbed the peace of French
ecclesiastics. The council of Nantes, for instance, in 1431, complains
that clergy were hurried out of their beds on Easter Monday, dragged
into church, and sprinkled with water upon the altar<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>. In this
aggravated form the <i>prisio</i> hardly survived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span> the frank manners of
the Middle Ages. But it was essentially identical with the ceremonies
in which a more modern usage has permitted the levying of forfeits at
both Pasque and Pentecost. In the north of England, women were liable
to have their shoes taken on one or other of these feasts, and must
redeem them by payment. On the following day they were entitled to
retaliate on the shoes of the men<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>. A more widely spread method of
exacting the <i>droit</i> is that of ‘heaving.’ The unwary wanderer
in some of the northern manufacturing towns on Easter Monday is still
liable to find himself swung high in the air by the stalwart hands of
factory girls, and will be lucky if he can purchase his liberty with
nothing more costly than a kiss. If he likes, he may take his revenge
on Easter Tuesday<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>. Another mediaeval custom described by Belethus
in the twelfth century, which prescribed the whipping of husbands by
wives on Easter Monday and of wives by husbands on Easter Tuesday, has
also its modern parallel<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>. On Shrove Tuesday a hockey match was
played at Leicester, and after it a number of young men took their
stand with cart whips in the precincts of the Castle. Any passer-by
who did not pay a forfeit was liable to lashes. The ‘whipping Toms,’
as they were called, were put down by a special Act of Parliament in
1847<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>. The analogy of these customs with the requirement made of
visitors to certain markets or to the roofs of houses in the building
to ‘pay their footing’ is obvious<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<p>In all these cases, even where the significant whipping or sprinkling
is absent, the meaning is the same. The binding with ropes, the loss
of the shoes, the lifting in the air, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> symbols of capture. And the
capture is for the purposes of sacrifice, for which no more suitable
victim, in substitution for the priest-king, than a stranger, could be
found. This will, I think, be clear by comparison with some further
parallels from the harvest field and the threshing-floor, in more
than one of which the symbolism is such as actually to indicate the
sacrifice itself, as well as the preliminary capture. In many parts
of England a stranger, and sometimes even the farmer himself, when
visiting a harvest field, is liable to be asked for ‘largess’<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>. In
Scotland, the tribute is called ‘head-money,’ and he who refuses is
seized by the arms and feet and ‘dumped’ on the ground<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. Similar
customs prevail on the continent, in Germany, Norway, France; and the
stranger is often, just as in the ‘hocking’ ceremony, caught with
straw ropes, or swathed in a sheaf of corn. It is mainly in Germany
that the still more elaborate rites survive. In various districts
of Mecklenburg, and of Pomerania, the reapers form a ring round the
stranger, and fiercely whet their scythes, sometimes with traditional
rhymes which contain a threat to mow him down. In Schleswig, and
again in Sweden, the stranger in a threshing-floor is ‘taught the
flail-dance’ or ‘the threshing-song.’ The arms of a flail are put round
his neck and pressed so tightly that he is nearly choked. When the
madder-roots are being dug, a stranger passing the field is caught by
the workers, and buried up to his middle in the soil<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>.</p>

<p>The central incident of ‘hocking’ appears therefore to be nothing but
a form of that symbolical capture of a human victim of which various
other examples are afforded by the village festivals. The development
of the custom into a play or mock-fight at Coventry may very well
have taken place, as the town annals say, about the beginning of the
fifteenth century. Whether it had previously been connected by local
tradition with some event in the struggles of Danes and Saxons or not,
is a question which one must be content to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> unsolved. A final
word is due to the curious arrangement by which in the group of customs
here considered the rôles of sacrificers and sacrificed are exchanged
between men and women on the second day; for it lends support to the
theory already put forward that a certain stage in the evolution of the
village worship was marked by the merging of previously independent
sex-cults.</p>

<p>The foregoing chapter has illustrated the remarkable variety of modes
in which the instinct of play comes to find expression. But of all such
the simplest and most primitive is undoubtedly the dance. Psychology
discovers in the dance the most rudimentary and physical of the arts,
and traces it to precisely that overflow of nervous energies shut off
from their normal practical ends which constitutes play<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>. And
the verdict of psychology is confirmed by philology; for in all the
Germanic languages the same word signifies both ‘dance’ and ‘play,’ and
in some of them it is even extended to the cognate ideas of ‘sacrifice’
or ‘festival<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>’. The dance must therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> be thought of as an
essential part of all the festivals with which we have to deal. And
with the dance comes song: the rhythms of motion seem to have been
invariably accompanied by the rhythms of musical instruments, or of the
voice, or of both combined<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>.</p>

<p>The dance had been from the beginning a subject of contention between
Christianity and the Roman world<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>; but whereas the dances of the
East and South, so obnoxious to the early Fathers, were mainly those
of professional entertainers, upon the stage or at banquets, the
missionaries of the West had to face the even more difficult problem
of a folk-dance and folk-song which were amongst the most inveterate
habits of the freshly converted peoples. As the old worship vanished,
these tended to attach themselves to the new. Upon great feasts and
wake-days, choruses of women invaded with wanton <i>cantica</i> and
<i>ballationes</i> the precincts of the churches and even the sacred
buildings themselves, a desecration against which generation after
generation of ecclesiastical authorities was fain to protest<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>.
Clerkly sentiment in the matter is represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> by a pious legend,
very popular in the Middle Ages, which told how some reprobate folk
of Kölbigk in Anhalt disobeyed the command of a priest to cease their
unholy revels before the church of Saint Magnus while he said mass
on Christmas day, and for their punishment must dance there the year
round without stopping<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>. The struggle was a long one, and in the
end the Church never quite succeeded even in expelling the dance from
its own doors. The chapter of Wells about 1338 forbade <i>choreae</i>
and other <i>ludi</i> within the cathedral and the cloisters, chiefly
on account of the damage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span> too often done to its property<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. A
seventeenth-century French writer records that he had seen clergy
and singing-boys dancing at Easter in the churches of Paris<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>;
and even at the present day there are some astounding survivals. At
Seville, as is well known, the six boys, called <i>los Seises</i>,
dance with castanets before the Holy Sacrament in the presence of the
archbishop at Shrovetide, and during the feasts of the Immaculate
Conception and Corpus Christi<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>. At Echternach in Luxembourg there
is an annual dance through the church of pilgrims to the shrine of St.
Willibrord<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>, while at Barjols in Provence a ‘tripe-dance’ is danced
at mass on St. Marcel’s day in honour of the patron<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>.</p>

<p>Still less, of course, did dance and song cease to be important
features of the secular side of the festivals. We have already seen
how <i>cantilenae</i> on the great deeds of heroes had their vogue in
the mouths of the <i>chori</i> of young men and maidens, as well as
in those of the minstrels<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>. The <i>Carmina Burana</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> describe
the dances of girls upon the meadows as amongst the pleasures of
spring<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>. William Fitzstephen tells us that such dances were to
be seen in London in the twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>, and we have found the
University of Oxford solemnly forbidding them in the thirteenth.
The <i>romans</i> and <i>pastourelles</i> frequently mention
<i>chansons</i> or <i>rondets de carole</i>, which appear to have been
the <i>chansons</i> used to accompany the choric dances, and to have
generally consisted of a series of couplets sung by the leader, and
a refrain with which the rest of the band answered him. Occasionally
the refrains are quoted<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>. The minstrels borrowed this type of folk
<i>chanson</i>, and the conjoint dance and song themselves found their
way from the village green to the courtly hall. In the twelfth century
ladies <i>carolent</i>, and more rarely even men condescend to take
a part<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>. Still later <i>carole</i>, like <i>tripudium</i>, seems
to become a term for popular rejoicing in general, not necessarily
expressed in rhythmical shape<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.</p>

<p>The customs of the village festival gave rise by natural development
to two types of dance<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>. There was the processional dance of the
band of worshippers in progress round their boundaries and from field
to field, from house to house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span> from well to well of the village. It
is this that survives in the dance of the Echternach pilgrims, or in
the ‘faddy-dance’ in and out the cottage doors at Helston wake. And
it is probably this that is at the bottom of the interesting game of
‘Thread the Needle.’ This is something like ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ the
first part of which, indeed, seems to have been adapted from it. There
is, however, no sacrifice or ‘tug-of-war,’ although there is sometimes
a ‘king,’ or a ‘king’ and his ‘lady’ or ‘bride’ in the accompanying
rhymes, and in one instance a ‘pancake.’ The players stand in two long
lines. Those at the end of each line form an arch with uplifted arms,
and the rest run in pairs beneath it. Then another pair form an arch,
and the process is repeated. In this way long strings of lads and
lasses stream up and down the streets or round and about a meadow or
green. In many parts of England this game is played annually on Shrove
Tuesday or Easter Monday, and the peasants who play it at Châtre in
central France say that it is done ‘to make the hemp grow.’ Its origin
in connexion with the agricultural festivals can therefore hardly be
doubtful<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>. It is probable that in the beginning the players danced
rather than ran under the ‘arch’; and it is obvious that the ‘figure’
of the game is practically identical with one familiar in <i>Sir Roger
de Coverley</i> and other old English ‘country’ dances of the same type.</p>

<p>Just as the ‘country’ dance is derived from the processional dance, so
the other type of folk-dance, the <i>ronde</i> or ‘round,’ is derived
from the comparatively stationary dance of the group of worshippers
around the more especially sacred objects of the festival, such as
the tree or the fire<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. The custom of dancing round the May-pole
has been more or less preserved wherever the May-pole is known. But
‘Thread the Needle’ itself often winds up with a circular dance or
<i>ronde</i>, either around one of the players, or, on festival
occasions, around the representative of the earlier home of the
fertilization divinity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span> the parish church. This custom is popularly
known as ‘clipping the church<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>.’</p>

<p>Naturally the worshippers at a festival would dance in their festival
costume; that is to say, in the garb of leaves and flowers worn for the
sake of the beneficent influence of the indwelling divinity, or in the
hides and horns of sacrificial animals which served a similar purpose.
Travellers describe elaborate and beautiful beast-dances amongst savage
peoples, and the Greeks had their own bear-and crane-dances, as well
as the dithyrambic goat-dance of the Dionysia. They had also flower
dances<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>. In England the village dancers wear posies, but I do not
know that they ever attempt a more elaborate representation of flowers.
But a good example of the beast-dance is furnished by the ‘horn-dance’
at Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire, held now at a September wake,
and formerly at Christmas. In this six of the performers wear sets
of horns. These are preserved from year to year in the church, and
according to local tradition the dance used at one time to take place
in the churchyard on a Sunday. The horns are said to be those of the
reindeer, and from this it may possibly be inferred that they were
brought to Abbots Bromley by Scandinavian settlers. The remaining
performers represent a hobby-horse, a clown, a woman, and an archer,
who makes believe to shoot the horned men<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>motifs</i> of the dances and their <i>chansons</i> must also
at first have been determined by the nature of the festivals at which
they took place. There were dances, no doubt, at such domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
festivals as weddings and funerals<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. In Flanders it is still the
custom to dance at the funeral of a young girl, and a very charming
<i>chanson</i> is used<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>. The development of epic poetry from the
<i>cantilenae</i> of the war-festival has been noted in a former
chapter. At the agricultural festivals, the primary <i>motif</i> is,
of course, the desire for the fertility of the crops and herds. The
song becomes, as in the Anglo-Saxon charm, so often referred to,
practically a prayer<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>. With this, and with the use of ‘Thread the
Needle’ at Châtre ‘to make the hemp grow,’ may be compared the games
known to modern children, as to Gargantua, in which the operations
of the farmer’s year, and in particular his prayer for his crops,
are mimicked in a <i>ronde</i><a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>. Allusions to the process of the
seasons, above all to the delight of the <i>renouveau</i> in spring,
would naturally also find a place in the festival songs. The words of
the famous thirteenth-century lyric were perhaps written to be sung to
the twinkling feet of English girls in a round. It has the necessary
refrain:</p>

<p>The savour of the spring is still in the English May songs, the French
<i>maierolles</i> or <i>calendes de mai</i> and the Italian <i>calen di
maggio</i>. But for the rest they have either become little but mere
<i>quête</i> songs, or else, under the influence of the priests, have
taken on a Christian colouring<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>. At Oxford the ‘merry ketches’ sung
by choristers on the top of Magdalen tower on May morning were replaced
in the seventeenth century by the hymn now used<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>. Another very
popular Mayers’ song would seem to show that the Puritans, in despair
of abolishing the festival, tried to reform it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Another religious element, besides prayer, may have
entered into the pre-Christian festival songs; and that is myth. A
stage in the evolution of drama from the Dionysiac dithyramb was the
introduction of mythical narratives about the wanderings and victories
of the god, to be chanted or recited by the <i>choragus</i>. The
relation of the <i>choragus</i> to the <i>chorus</i> bears a close
analogy to that between the leader of the mediaeval <i>carole</i> and
his companions who sang the refrain. This leader probably represents
the Keltic or Teutonic priest at the head of his band of worshippers;
and one may suspect that in the north and west of Europe, as in
Greece, the pauses of the festival dance provided the occasion on
which the earliest strata of stories about the gods, the hieratic
as distinguished from the literary myths, took shape. If so the
development of divine myth was very closely parallel to that of heroic
myth<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>.</p>

<p>After religion, the commonest <i>motif</i> of dance and song at the
village festivals must have been love. This is quite in keeping with
the amorous licence which was one of their characteristics. The goddess
of the fertility of earth was also the goddess of the fertility of
women. The ecclesiastical prohibitions lay particular stress upon the
<i>orationes amatoriae</i> and the <i>cantica turpia et luxuriosa</i>
which the women sang at the church doors, and only as love-songs
can be interpreted the <i>winileodi</i> forbidden to the inmates of
convents by a capitulary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> of 789<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>. The love-interest continues to
be prominent in the folk-song, or the minstrel song still in close
relation to folk-song, of mediaeval and modern France. The beautiful
wooing <i>chanson</i> of <i>Transformations</i>, which savants have
found it difficult to believe not to be a <i>supercherie</i>, is
sung by harvesters and by lace-makers at the pillow<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>. That of
<i>Marion</i>, an ironic expression of wifely submission, belongs to
Shrove Tuesday<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>. These are modern, but the following, from the
<i>Chansonnier de St. Germain</i>, may be a genuine mediaeval folk-song
of Limousin <i>provenance</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘A l’entrada dal tems clar, eya,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Per joja recomençar, eya,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et per jelos irritar, eya,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vol la regina mostrar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qu’el’ es si amoroza.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alavi’, alavia jelos,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laissaz nos, laissaz nos</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ballar entre nos, entre nos<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The ‘queen’ here is, of course, the festival queen
or lady of the May, the <i>regina avrillosa</i> of the Latin
writers, <i>la reine</i>, <i>la mariée</i>, <i>l’épousée</i>,
<i>la trimousette</i> of popular custom<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>. The defiance of the
<i>jelos</i>, and the desire of the queen and her maidens to dance
alone, recall the conventional freedom of women from restraint in May,
the month of their ancient sex-festival, and the month in which the
mediaeval wife-beater still ran notable danger of a <i>chevauchée</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>The amorous note recurs in those types of minstrel song which are
most directly founded upon folk models. Such are the <i>chansons à
danser</i> with their refrains, the <i>chansons de mal mariées</i>, in
which the ‘<i>jalous</i>’ is often introduced, the <i>aubes</i> and the
<i>pastourelles</i><a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>. Common in all of these is the spring setting
proper to the <i>chansons</i> of our festivals, and of the ‘queen’ or
‘king’ there is from time to time mention. The leading theme of the
<i>pastourelles</i> is the wooing, successful or the reverse, of a
shepherdess by a knight. But the shepherdess has generally also a lover
of her own degree, and for this pair the names of Robin and Marion seem
to have been conventionally appropriated. Robin was perhaps borrowed by
the <i>pastourelles</i> from the widely spread refrain</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Robins m’aime, Robins m’a:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Robins m’a demandée: si m’ara<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The borrowing may, of course, have been the other way
round, but the close relation of the <i>chanson à danser</i> with its
refrain to the dance suggests that this was the earliest type of lyric
minstrelsy to be evolved, as well as the closest to the folk-song
pattern. The <i>pastourelle</i> forms a link between folk-song and
drama, for towards the end of the thirteenth century Adan de la Hale,
known as ‘le Bossu,’ a minstrel of Arras, wrote a <i>Jeu de Robin et
Marion</i>, which is practically a <i>pastourelle par personnages</i>.
The familiar theme is preserved. A knight woos Marion, who is faithful
to her Robin. Repulsed, he rides away, but returns and beats Robin.
All, however, ends happily with dances and <i>jeux</i> amongst the
peasants. Adan de la Hale was one of the train of Count Robert of
Artois in Italy. The play may originally have been written about 1283
for the delectation of the court of Robert’s kinsman, Charles, king
of Naples, but the extant version was probably produced about 1290
at Arras, when the poet was already dead. Another hand has prefixed
a dramatic prologue, the <i>Jeu du Pèlerin</i>, glorifying Adan, and
has also made some interpolations in the text designed to localize
the action near Arras.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span> The performers are not likely to have been
villagers: they may have been the members of some <i>puy</i> or
literary society, which had taken over the celebration of the summer
festival. In any case the <i>Jeu de Robin et Marion</i> is the earliest
and not the least charming of pastoral comedies<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>.</p>

<p>It is impossible exactly to parallel from the history of English
literature this interaction of folk-song and minstrelsy at the French
<i>fête du mai</i>. For unfortunately no body of English mediaeval
lyric exists. Even ‘Sumer is icumen in’ only owes its preservation
to the happy accident which led some priest to fit sacred words to
the secular tune; while the few pieces recovered from a Harleian
manuscript of the reign of Edward I, beautiful as they are, read
like adaptations less of English folk-song, than of French lyric
itself<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>. Nevertheless, the village summer festival of England seems
to have closely resembled that of France, and to have likewise taken in
the long run a dramatic turn. A short sketch of it will not be without
interest.</p>

<p>I have quoted at the beginning of this discussion of folk-customs the
thirteenth-century condemnations of the <i>Inductio Maii</i> by Bishop
Grosseteste of Lincoln and of the <i>ludi de Rege et Regina</i> by
Bishop Chanteloup of Worcester. The <i>ludus de Rege et Regina</i> is
not indeed necessarily to be identified with the <i>Inductio Maii</i>,
for the harvest feast or <i>Inductio Autumni</i> of Bishop Grosseteste
had also its ‘king’ and ‘queen,’ and so too had some of the feasts in
the winter cycle, notably Twelfth night<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. It is, however, in the
summer feast held usually on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span> the first of May or at Whitsuntide<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>,
that these rustic dignitaries are more particularly prominent. Before
the middle of the fifteenth century I have not come across many notices
of them. That a summer king was familiar in Scotland is implied by
the jest of Robert Bruce’s wife after his coronation at Scone in
1306<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>. In 1412 a ‘somerkyng’ received a reward from the bursar of
Winchester College<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>. But from about 1450 onwards they begin to
appear frequently in local records. The whole <i>ludus</i> is generally
known as a ‘May-play’ or ‘May-game,’ or as a ‘king-play<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>,’
‘king’s revel<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>,’ or ‘king-game<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>.’ The leading personages
are indifferently the ‘king’ and ‘queen,’ or ‘lord’ and ‘lady.’ But
sometimes the king is more specifically the ‘somerkyng’ or <i>rex
aestivalis</i>. At other times he is the ‘lord of misrule<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>,’ or
takes a local title, such as that of the ‘Abbot of Marham,’ ‘Mardall,’
‘Marrall,’ ‘Marram,’ ‘Mayvole’ or ‘Mayvoll’ at Shrewsbury<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>, and the
‘Abbot of Bon-Accord’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> at Aberdeen<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>. The use of an ecclesiastical
term will be explained in a later chapter<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. The queen appears to
have been sometimes known as a ‘whitepot’ queen<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>. And finally the
king and queen receive, in many widely separated places, the names of
Robin Hood and Maid Marian, and are accompanied in their revels by
Little John, Friar Tuck, and the whole joyous fellowship of Sherwood
Forest<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>. This affiliation of the <i>ludus de Rege et Regina</i>
to the Robin Hood legend is so curious as to deserve a moment’s
examination<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>.</p>

<p>The earliest recorded mention of Robin Hood is in Langland’s <i>Piers
Plowman</i>, written about 1377. Here he is coupled with another great
popular hero of the north as a subject of current songs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘But I can rymes of Robyn hood, and Randolf erle of Chestre<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the following century his fame as a great outlaw
spread far and wide, especially in the north and the midlands<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>.
The Scottish chronicler Bower tells us in 1447 that whether for comedy
or tragedy no other subject of romance and minstrelsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span> had such a
hold upon the common folk<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>. The first of the extant ballads of
the cycle, <i>A Gest of Robyn Hode</i>, was probably printed before
1500, and in composition may be at least a century earlier. A recent
investigator of the legend, and a very able one, denies to Robin Hood
any traceable historic origin. He is, says Dr. Child, ‘absolutely a
creation of the ballad muse.’ However this may be, the version of
the Elizabethan playwright Anthony Munday, who made him an earl of
Huntingdon and the lover of Matilda the daughter of Lord Fitzwater,
may be taken as merely a fabrication. And whether he is historical or
not, it is difficult to see how he got, as by the sixteenth century
he did get, into the May-game. One theory is that he was there from
the beginning, and that he is in fact a mythological figure, whose
name but faintly disguises either Woden in the aspect of a vegetation
deity<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>, or a minor wood-spirit Hode, who also survives in the
Hodeken of German legend<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>. Against this it may be pointed out,
firstly that Hood is not an uncommon English name, probably meaning
nothing but ‘à-Wood’ or ‘of the wood<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>,’ and secondly that we
have seen no reason to suppose that the mock king, which is the part
assigned to Robin Hood in the May-game, was ever regarded as an
incarnation of the fertilization spirit at all. He is the priest of
that spirit, slain at its festival, but nothing more. I venture to
offer a more plausible explanation. It is noticeable that whereas in
the May-game Robin Hood and Maid Marian are inseparable, in the early
ballads Maid Marian has no part. She is barely mentioned in one or
two of the latest ones<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>. Moreover Marian is not an English but a
French name, and we have already seen that Robin and Marion are the
typical shepherd and shepherdess of the French <i>pastourelles</i>
and of Adan de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> la Hale’s dramatic <i>jeu</i> founded upon these. I
suggest then, that the names were introduced by the minstrels into
English and transferred from the French <i>fêtes du mai</i> to the
‘lord’ and ‘lady’ of the corresponding English May-game. Robin Hood
grew up independently from heroic <i>cantilenae</i>, but owing to the
similarity of name he was identified with the other Robin, and brought
Little John, Friar Tuck and the rest with him into the May-game. On
the other hand Maid Marian, who does not properly belong to the heroic
legend, was in turn, naturally enough, adopted into the later ballads.
This is an hypothesis, but not, I think, an unlikely hypothesis.</p>

<p>Of what, then, did the May-game, as it took shape in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, consist? Primarily, no doubt, of a <i>quête</i>
or ‘gaderyng.’ In many places this became a parochial, or even a
municipal, affair. In 1498 the corporation of Wells possessed moneys
‘<i>provenientes ante hoc tempus de Robynhode</i><a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>.’ Elsewhere
the churchwardens paid the expenses of the feast and accounted for
the receipts in the annual parish budget<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. There are many entries
concerning the May-game in the accounts of Kingston-on-Thames during
some half a century. In 1506 it is recorded that ‘Wylm. Kempe’ was
‘kenge’ and ‘Joan Whytebrede’ was ‘quen.’ In 1513 and again in 1536
the game went to Croydon<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. Similarly the accounts of New Romney
note that in 1422 or thereabouts the men of Lydd ‘came with their
may and ours<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>,’ and those of Reading St. Lawrence that in 1505
came ‘Robyn Hod of Handley and his company’ and in 1507 ‘Robyn Hod
and his company from ffynchamsted<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>.’ In contemporary Scotland
James IV gave a present at midsummer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span> in 1503 ‘to Robin Hude of
Perth<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>.’ It would hardly have been worth while, however, to carry
the May-game from one village or town to another, had it been nothing
but a procession with a garland and a ‘gaderyng’; and as a matter
of fact we find that in England as in France dramatic performances
came to be associated with the summer folk-festivals. The London
‘Maying’ included stage plays<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>. At Shrewsbury <i>lusores</i> under
the Abbot of Marham acted interludes ‘for the glee of the town’ at
Pentecost<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>. The guild of St. Luke at Norwich performed secular as
well as miracle plays, and the guild of Holy Cross at Abingdon held
its feast on May 3 with ‘pageants, plays and May-games,’ as early as
1445<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. Some of these plays were doubtless miracles, but so far as
they were secular, the subjects of them were naturally drawn, in the
absence of <i>pastourelles</i>, from the ballads of the Robin Hood
cycle<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. Amongst the Paston letters is preserved one written in
1473, in which the writer laments the loss of a servant, whom he has
kept ‘thys iij yer to pleye Seynt Jorge and Robyn Hod and the Shryff
off Nottyngham<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.’ Moreover, some specimens of the plays themselves
are still extant. One of them, unfortunately only a fragment, must be
the very play referred to in the letter just quoted, for its subject
is ‘Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham,’ and it is found on a
scrap of paper formerly in the possession of Sir John Fenn, the first
editor of the <i>Paston Letters</i><a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>. A second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span> play on ‘Robin
Hood and the Friar’ and a fragment of a third on ‘Robin Hood and the
Potter’ were printed by Copland in the edition of the <i>Gest of Robyn
Hode</i> published by him about 1550<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>. The Robin Hood plays are,
of course, subsequent to the development of religious drama which will
be discussed in the next volume. They are of the nature of interludes,
and were doubtless written, like the plays of Adan de la Hale, by some
clerk or minstrel for the delectation of the villagers. They are,
therefore, in a less degree folk-drama, than the examples which we
shall have to consider in the next chapter. But it is worthy of notice,
that even in the hey-day of the stage under Elizabeth and James I, the
summer festival continued to supply motives to the dramatists. Anthony
Munday’s <i>Downfall and Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon</i><a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>,
Chapman’s <i>May-Day</i>, and Jonson’s delightful fragment <i>The Sad
Shepherd</i> form an interesting group of pastoral comedies, affinities
to which may be traced in the <i>As You Like It</i> and <i>Winter’s
Tale</i> of Shakespeare himself.</p>

<p>As has been said, it is impossible to establish any direct affiliation
between the Robin Hood plays and earlier <i>caroles</i> on the same
theme, in the way in which this can be done for the <i>jeu</i> of Adan
de la Hale, and the Robin and Marion of the <i>pastourelles</i>. The
extant Robin Hood ballads are certainly not <i>caroles</i>; they are
probably not folk-song at all, but minstrelsy of a somewhat debased
type. The only actual trace of such <i>caroles</i> that has been come
across is the mention of ‘Robene hude’ as the name of a dance in the
<i>Complaynt of Scotland</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span> about 1548<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>. Dances, however, of one
kind or another, there undoubtedly were at the May-games. The Wells
corporation accounts mention <i>puellae tripudiantes</i> in close
relation with <i>Robynhode</i><a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>. And particularly there was the
morris-dance, which was so universally in use on May-day, that it
borrowed, almost in permanence, for its leading character the name of
Maid Marian. The morris-dance, however, is common to nearly all the
village feasts, and its origin and nature will be matter for discussion
in the next chapter.</p>

<p>In many places, even during the Middle Ages, and still more
afterwards, the summer feast dropped out or degenerated. It became a
mere beer-swilling, an ‘ale<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.’ And so we find in the sixteenth
century a ‘king-ale<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>’ or a ‘Robin Hood’s ale<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>,’ and in modern
times a ‘Whitsun-ale<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>,’ a ‘lamb-ale<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>’
    or a ‘gyst-ale<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>’
beside the ‘church-ales’ and ‘scot-ales’ which the thirteenth-century
bishops had already condemned<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>. On the other hand, the village
festival found its way to court, and became a sumptuous pageant under
the splendour-loving Tudors. For this, indeed, there was Arthurian
precedent in the romance of Malory, who records how Guenever was taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
by Sir Meliagraunce, when ‘as the queen had mayed and all her knights,
all were bedashed with herbs, mosses, and flowers, in the best manner
and freshest<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>.’ The chronicler Hall tells of the Mayings of Henry
VIII in 1510, 1511, and 1515. In the last of these some hundred and
thirty persons took part. Henry was entertained by Robin Hood and the
rest with shooting-matches and a collation of venison in a bower; and
returning was met by a chariot in which rode the Lady May and the
Lady Flora, while on the five horses sat the Ladies Humidity, Vert,
Vegetave, Pleasaunce and Sweet Odour<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. Obviously the pastime
has here degenerated in another direction. It has become learned,
allegorical, and pseudo-classic. At the Reformation the May-game and
the May-pole were marks for Puritan onslaught. Latimer, in one of his
sermons before Edward VI, complains how, when he had intended to preach
in a certain country town on his way to London, he was told that he
could not be heard, for ‘it is Robyn hoodes daye. The parishe are gone
a brode to gather for Robyn hoode<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>.’ Machyn’s <i>Diary</i> mentions
the breaking of a May-pole in Fenchurch by the lord mayor of 1552<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>,
and the revival of elaborate and heterogeneous May-games throughout
London during the brief span of Queen Mary<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>. The Elizabethan
Puritans renewed the attack, but though something may have been done by
reforming municipalities here and there to put down the festivals<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>,
the ecclesiastical authorities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> could not be induced to go much beyond
forbidding them to take place in churchyards<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>. William Stafford,
indeed, declared in 1581 that ‘May-games, wakes, and revels’ were
‘now laid down<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>,’ but the violent abuse directed against them
only two years later by Philip Stubbes, which may be taken as a fair
sample of the Puritan polemic as a whole, shows that this was far from
being really the case<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>. In Scotland the Parliament ordered, as
early as 1555, that no one ‘be chosen Robert Hude, nor Lytill Johne,
Abbot of vnressoun, Quenis of Maij, nor vtherwyse, nouther in Burgh
nor to landwart in ony tyme to cum<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>.’ But the prohibition was not
very effective, for in 1577 and 1578 the General Assembly is found
petitioning for its renewal<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>. And in England no similar action was
taken until 1644 when the Long Parliament decreed the destruction of
such May-poles as the municipalities had spared. Naturally this policy
was reversed at the Restoration, and a new London pole was erected in
the Strand, hard by Somerset House, which endured until 1717<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—The books mentioned in the
bibliographical note to the last chapter should be consulted
on the general tendency to μίμησις in festival dance and song.
The symbolical dramatic ceremonies of the <i>renouveau</i> are
collected by Dr. J. G. Frazer in <i>The Golden Bough</i>. The
sword-dance has been the subject of two elaborate studies: K.
Müllenhoff, <i>Ueber den Schwerttanz</i>, in <i>Festgaben für
Gustav Homeyer</i> (1871), iii, with additions in <i>Zeitschrift
für deutsches Alterthum</i>, xviii. 9, xx. 10; and F. A. Mayer,
<i>Ein deutsches Schwerttanzspiel aus Ungarn</i> (with full
bibliography), in <i>Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie</i>
(1889), 204, 416. The best accounts of the morris-dance are in F.
Douce, <i>Illustrations of Shakespeare</i> (1807, new ed. 1839),
and A. Burton, <i>Rushbearing</i> (1891), 95.]</p>
</div>


<p>The last two chapters have afforded more than one example of village
festival customs ultimately taking shape as drama. But neither the
English Robin Hood plays, nor the French <i>Jeu de Robin et Marion</i>,
can be regarded as folk-drama in the proper sense of the word. They
were written not by the folk themselves, but by <i>trouvères</i> or
minstrels <i>for</i> the folk; and at a period when the independent
evolution of the religious play had already set a model of dramatic
composition. Probably the same is true of the Hox Tuesday play in
the form in which we may conjecture it to have been presented before
Elizabeth late in the sixteenth century. Nevertheless it is possible
to trace, apart from minstrel intervention and apart from imitation of
miracles, the existence of certain embryonic dramatic tendencies in
the village ceremonies themselves. Too much must not be made of these.
Jacob Grimm was inclined to find in them the first vague beginnings
of the whole of modern drama<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>. This is demonstrably wrong. Modern
drama arose, by a fairly well defined line of evolution, from a
threefold source, the ecclesiastical liturgy, the farce of the mimes,
the classical revivals of humanism. Folk-drama contributed but the
tiniest rill to the mighty stream. Such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span> it was, however, a couple
of further chapters may be not unprofitably spent in its analysis.</p>

<p>The festival customs include a number of dramatic rites which appear
to have been originally symbolical expressions of the facts of
seasonal recurrence lying at the root of the festivals themselves.
The antithesis of winter and summer, the <i>renouveau</i> of spring,
are mimed in three or four distinct fashions. The first and the most
important, as well as the most widespread of these, is the mock
representation of a death or burial. Dr. Frazer has collected many
instances of the ceremony known as the ‘expulsion of Death<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>.’ This
takes place at various dates in spring and early summer, but most
often on the fourth Sunday in Lent, one of the many names of which is
consequently <i>Todten-Sonntag</i>. An effigy is made, generally of
straw, but in some cases of birch twigs, a beechen bough, or other such
material. This is called Death, is treated with marks of fear, hatred
or contempt, and is finally carried in procession, and thrust over
the boundary of the village. Or it is torn in pieces, buried, burnt,
or thrown into a river or pool. Sometimes the health or other welfare
of the folk during the year is held to depend on the rite being duly
performed. The fragments of Death have fertilizing efficacy for women
and cattle; they are put in the fields, the mangers, the hens’ nests.
Here and there women alone take part in the ceremony, but more often
it is common to the whole village. The expulsion of Death is found in
various parts of Teutonic Germany, but especially in districts such as
Thuringia, Bohemia, Silesia, where the population is wholly or mainly
Slavonic. A similar custom, known both in Slavonic districts and in
Italy, France, and Spain, had the name of ‘sawing the old woman.’ At
Florence, for instance, the effigy of an old woman was placed on a
ladder. At Mid Lent it was sawn through, and the nuts and dried fruits
with which it was stuffed scrambled for by the crowd. At Palermo there
was a still more realistic representation with a real old woman, to
whose neck a bladder of blood was fitted<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>The ‘Death’ of the German and Slavonic form of the custom has clearly
come to be regarded as the personification of the forces of evil within
the village; and the ceremony of expulsion may be compared with other
periodical rites, European and non-European, in which evil spirits are
similarly expelled<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>. The effigy may even be regarded in the light
of a scapegoat, bearing away the sins of the community<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>. But it is
doubtful how far the notion of evil spirits warring against the good
spirits which protect man and his crops is a European, or at any rate
a primitive European one<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>; and it may perhaps be taken for granted
that what was originally thought to be expelled in the rite was not so
much either ‘Death’ or ‘Sin’ as winter. This view is confirmed by the
evidence of an eighth-century homily, which speaks of the expulsion
of winter in February as a relic of pagan belief<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>. Moreover, the
expulsion of Death is often found in the closest relation to the more
widespread custom of bringing summer, in the shape of green tree or
bough, into the village. The procession which carries away the dead
effigy brings back the summer tree; and the rhymes used treat the two
events as connected<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>.</p>

<p>The homily just quoted suggests that the mock funeral or expulsion of
winter was no new thing in the eighth century. On the other hand, it
can hardly be supposed that customs which imply such abstract ideas
as death, or even as summer and winter, belong to the earliest stages
of the village festival. What has happened is what happens in other
forms of festival play. The instinct of play, in this case finding
vent in a dramatic representation of the succession of summer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
winter, has taken hold of and adapted to its own purposes elements
in the celebrations which, once significant, have gradually come to
be mere traditional survivals. Such are the ceremonial burial in the
ground, the ceremonial burning, the ceremonial plunging into water,
of the representative of the fertilization spirit. In particular,
the southern term ‘the old woman’ suggests that the effigy expelled
or destroyed is none other than the ‘corn mother’ or ‘harvest-May,’
fashioned to represent the fertilization spirit out of the last sheaf
at harvest, and preserved until its place is taken by a new and green
representative in the spring.</p>

<p>There are, however, other versions of the mock death in which the
central figure of the little drama is not the representative of the
fertilization spirit itself, but one of the worshippers. In Bavaria
the Whitsuntide <i>Pfingstl</i> is dressed in leaves and water-plants
with a cap of peonies. He is soused with water, and then, in mimicry,
has his head cut off. Similar customs prevail in the Erzgebirge and
elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>. We have seen this <i>Pfingstl</i> before. He is
the Jack in the green, the worshipper clad in the god under whose
protection he desires to put himself<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>. But how can the killing
of him symbolize the spring, for obviously it is the coming summer,
not the dying winter, that the leaf-clad figure must represent? The
fact is that the Bavarian drama is not complete. The full ceremony is
found in other parts of Germany. Thus in Saxony and Thuringia a ‘wild
man’ covered with leaves and moss is hunted in a wood, caught, and
executed. Then comes forward a lad dressed as a doctor, who brings the
victim to life again by bleeding<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. Even so annually the summer dies
and has its resurrection. In Swabia, again, on Shrove Tuesday, ‘Dr.
Eisenbart’ bleeds a man to death, and afterwards revives him. This
same Dr. Eisenbart appears also in the Swabian Whitsuntide execution,
although here too the actual resurrection seems to have dropped out of
the ceremony<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> interesting to note that the green man of the
peasantry, who dies and lives again, reappears as the Green Knight in
one of the most famous divisions of Arthurian romance<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>.</p>

<p>The mock death or burial type of folk-drama resolves itself, then,
into two varieties. In one, it is winter whose passing is represented,
and for this the discarded harvest-May serves as a nucleus. In the
other, which is not really complete without a resurrection, it is
summer, whose death is mimed merely as a preliminary to its joyful
renewal; and this too is built up around a fragment of ancient cult
in the person of the leaf-clad worshipper, who is, indeed, none other
than the priest-king, once actually, and still in some sort and show,
slain at the festival<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>. In the instances so far dealt with, the
original significance of the rite is still fairly traceable. But there
are others into which new meanings, due to the influence of Christian
custom, have been read. In many parts of Germany customs closely
analogous to those of the expulsion of winter or Death take place
on Shrove Tuesday, and have suffered metamorphosis into ‘burial of
the Carnival<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.’ England affords the ‘Jack o’ Lent’ effigy which
is taken to represent Judas Iscariot<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>, the Lincoln ‘funeral of
Alleluia<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>,’ the Tenby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
    ‘making Christ’s bed<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>,’ the Monkton
‘risin’ and buryin’ Peter<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>.’ The truth that the vitality of a folk
custom is far greater than that of any single interpretation of it is
admirably illustrated.</p>

<p>Two other symbolical representations of the phenomena of the
<i>renouveau</i> must be very briefly treated. At Briançon in Dauphiné,
instead of a death and resurrection, is used a pretty little May-day
drama, in which the leaf-clad man falls into sleep upon the ground
and is awakened by the kiss of a maiden<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>. Russia has a similar
custom; and such a magic kiss, bringing summer with it, lies at the
heart of the story of the Sleeping Beauty. Indeed, the marriage of
heaven and earth seems to have been a myth very early invented by the
Aryan mind to explain the fertility of crops beneath the rain, and
it probably received dramatic form in religious ceremonies both in
Greece and Italy<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>. Finally, there is a fairly widespread spring
custom of holding a dramatic fight between two parties, one clad in
green to represent summer, the other in straw or fur to represent
winter. Waldron describes this in the Isle of Man<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>; Olaus Magnus
in Sweden<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>. Grimm says that it is found in various districts on
both sides of the middle Rhine<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>. Perhaps both this dramatic battle
and that of the Coventry Hox Tuesday owe their origin to the struggle
for the fertilizing head of a sacrificial animal, which also issued
in football and similar games. Dr. Frazer quotes several instances
from all parts of the world in which a mock fight, or an interchange
of abuse and raillery taking the place of an actual fight, serves as
a crop-charm<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>. The summer and winter battle gave to literature
a famous type of neo-Latin and Romance <i>débat</i><a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>. In one of
the most interesting forms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> this, the eighth-or ninth-century
<i>Conflictus Veris et Hiemis</i>, the subject of dispute is the
cuckoo, which spring praises and winter chides, while the shepherds
declare that he must be drowned or stolen away, because summer cometh
not. The cuckoo is everywhere a characteristic bird of spring, and
his coming was probably a primitive signal for the high summer
festival<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>.</p>

<p>The symbolical dramas of the seasons stand alone and independent,
but it may safely be asserted that drama first arose at the village
feasts in close relation to the dance. That dancing, like all
the arts, tends to be mimetic is a fact which did not escape the
attention of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>. The pantomimes of the decadent Roman
stage are a case in point. Greek tragedy itself had grown out of
the Dionysiac dithyramb, and travellers describe how readily the
dances of the modern savage take shape as primitive dramas of war,
hunting, love, religion, labour, or domestic life<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. Doubtless
this was the case also with the <i>caroles</i> of the European
festivals. The types of <i>chanson</i> most immediately derived from
these are full of dialogue, and already on the point of bursting
into drama. That they did do this, with the aid of the minstrels, in
the <i>Jeu de Robin et de Marion</i> we have seen<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>. A curious
passage in the <i>Itinerarium Cambriae</i> of Giraldus Cambrensis
(†1188) describes a dance of peasants in and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>about the church of
St. Elined, near Brecknock on the Gwyl Awst, in which the ordinary
operations of the village life, such as ploughing, sewing, spinning
were mimetically represented<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>. Such dances seem to survive in
some of the <i>rondes</i> or ‘singing-games,’ so frequently dramatic,
of children<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>. On the whole, perhaps, these connect themselves
rather with the domestic than with the strictly agricultural element
in village cult. A large proportion of them are concerned with
marriage. But the domestic and the agricultural cannot be altogether
dissociated. The game of ‘Nuts in May,’ for instance, seems to have
as its kernel a reminiscence of marriage by capture; but the ‘nuts’
or rather ‘knots’ or ‘posies’ ‘in May’ certainly suggest a setting
at a seasonal festival. So too, with ‘Round the Mulberry Bush.’ The
mimicry here is of domestic operations, but the ‘bush’ recalls the
sacred tree, the natural centre of the seasonal dances. The closest
parallels to the dance described by Giraldus Cambrensis are to be
found in the <i>rondes</i> of ‘Oats and Beans and Barley’ and ‘Would
you know how doth the Peasant?’, in which the chief, though not always
the only, subjects of mimicry are ploughing, sowing and the like, and
which frequently contain a prayer or aspiration for the welfare of the
crops<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>I have treated the mimetic element of budding drama in the agricultural
festivals as being primarily a manifestation of the activities of play
determined in its direction by the dominant interests of the occasion,
and finding its material in the débris of ritual custom left over from
forgotten stages of religious thought. It is possible also to hold that
the <i>mimesis</i> is more closely interwoven with the religious and
practical side of the festivals, and is in fact yet another example of
that primitive magical notion of causation by the production of the
similar, which is at the root of the rain-and sun-charms. Certainly the
village dramas, like the other ceremonies which they accompany, are
often regarded as influencing the luck of the farmer’s year; just as
the hunting-and war-dances of savages are often regarded not merely as
amusement or as practice for actual war and hunting, but as charms to
secure success in these pursuits<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>. But it does not seem clear to me
that in this case the magical efficacy belongs to the drama from the
beginning, and I incline to look upon it as merely part of the sanctity
of the feast as a whole, which has attached itself in the course of
time even to that side of it which began as play.</p>

<p>The evolution of folk-drama out of folk-dance may be most
completely studied through a comparison of the various types of
European sword-dance with the so-called ‘mummers’,’ ‘guisers’,’ or
‘Pace-eggers’’ play of Saint George. The history of the sword-dance
has received a good deal of attention from German archaeologists, who,
however, perhaps from imperfect acquaintance with the English data,
have stopped short of the affiliation to it of the play<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>. The dance
itself can boast a hoar antiquity. Tacitus describes it as the one
form of <i>spectaculum</i> to be seen at the gatherings of the Germans
with whom he was conversant. The dancers were young men who leapt with
much agility amongst menacing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> spear-points and sword-blades<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>.
Some centuries later the use of <i>sweorda-gelac</i> as a metaphor
for battle in <i>Beowulf</i> shows that the term was known to the
continental ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>. Then follows a
long gap in the record, bridged only by a doubtful reference in an
eighth-century Frankish homily<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>, and a possible representation in
a ninth-century Latin and Anglo-Saxon manuscript<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>. The minstrels
seem to have adopted the sword-dance into their repertory<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>, but
the earliest mediaeval notice of it as a popular <i>ludus</i> is at
Nuremberg in 1350. From that date onwards until quite recent years it
crops up frequently, alike at Shrovetide, Christmas and other folk
festivals, and as an element in the revels at weddings, royal entries,
and the like<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>. It is fairly widespread throughout Germany. It
is found in Italy, where it is called the <i>mattaccino</i><a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>,
and in Spain (<i>matachin</i>), and under this name or that of the
<i>danse des bouffons</i> it was known both in France and England
at the Renaissance<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>. It is given by Paradin in his <i>Le Blason
des Danses</i> and, with the music and cuts of the performers, by
Tabourot in his <i>Orchésographie</i> (1588)<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>. These are the
sophisticated versions of courtly halls. But about the same date Olaus
Magnus describes it as a folk-dance, to the accompaniment of pipes or
<i>cantilenae</i>, in Sweden<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. In England, the main area of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
acknowledged sword-dance is in the north. It is found, according to Mr.
Henderson, from the Humber to the Cheviots; and it extends as far south
as Cheshire and Nottinghamshire<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>. Outlying examples are recorded
from Winchester<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> and from Devonshire<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>. In Scotland Sir Walter
Scott found it among the farthest Hebrides, and it has also been traced
in Fifeshire<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>.</p>

<p>The name of <i>danse des bouffons</i> sometimes given to the
sword-dance may be explained by a very constant feature of the
English examples, in which the dancers generally include or are
accompanied by one or more comic or grotesque personages. The types
of these grotesques are not kept very distinct in the descriptions,
or, probably, in fact. But they appear to be fundamentally two. There
is the ‘Tommy’ or ‘fool,’ who wears the skin and tail of a fox or
some other animal, and there is the ‘Bessy,’ who is a man dressed in
a woman’s clothes. And they can be paralleled from outside England.
A <i>Narr</i> or <i>Fasching</i> (carnival fool) is a figure in
several German sword-dances, and in one from Bohemia he has his female
counterpart in a <i>Mehlweib</i><a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>.</p>

<p>With the <i>cantilenae</i> noticed by Olaus Magnus may be compared the
sets of verses with which several modern sword-dances, both in these
islands and in Germany, are provided. They are sung before or during
part of the dances, and as a rule are little more than an introduction
of the performers, to whom they give distinctive names. If they contain
any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> incident, it is generally of the nature of a quarrel, in which
one of the dancers or one of the grotesques is killed. To this point
it will be necessary to return. The names given to the characters
are sometimes extremely nondescript; sometimes, under a more or less
literary influence, of an heroic order. Here and there a touch of
something more primitive may be detected. Five sets of verses from the
north of England are available in print. Two of these are of Durham
<i>provenance</i>. One, from Houghton-le-Spring, has, besides the
skin-clad ‘Tommy’ and the ‘Bessy,’ five dancers. These are King George,
a Squire’s Son also called Alick or Alex, a King of Sicily, Little
Foxey, and a Pitman<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>. The other Durham version has a captain called
True Blue, a Squire’s Son, Mr. Snip a tailor, a Prodigal Son (replaced
in later years by a Sailor), a Skipper, a Jolly Dog. There is only
one clown, who calls himself a ‘fool,’ and acts as treasurer. He is
named Bessy, but wears a hairy cap with a fox’s brush pendent<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>.
Two other versions come from Yorkshire. At Wharfdale there are seven
dancers, Thomas the clown, his son Tom, Captain Brown, Obadiah Trim a
tailor, a Foppish Knight, Love-ale a vintner, and Bridget the clown’s
wife<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>. At Linton in Craven there are five, the clown, Nelson, Jack
Tar, Tosspot, and Miser a woman<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. The fifth version is of unnamed
locality. It has two clowns, Tommy in skin and tail, and Bessy, and
amongst the dancers are a Squire’s Son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span> and a Tailor<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>. Such a
nomenclature will not repay much analysis. The ‘Squire,’ whose son
figures amongst the dancers, is identical with the ‘Tommy,’ although
why he should have a son I do not know. Similarly, the ‘Bridget’ at
Wharfdale and the ‘Miser’ at Linton correspond to the ‘Bessy’ who
appears elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Shetland dance, so far as the names go, is far more literary
and less of a folk affair than any of the English examples. The
grotesques are absent altogether, and the dancers belong wholly to
that heroic category which is also represented in a degenerate form
at Houghton-le-Spring. They are in fact those ‘seven champions of
Christendom’—St. George of England, St. James of Spain, St. Denys of
France, St. David of Wales, St. Patrick of Ireland, St. Anthony of
Italy, and St. Andrew of Scotland—whose legends were first brought
together under that designation by Richard Johnson in 1596<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>.</p>

<p>Precisely the same divergence between a popular and a literary or
heroic type of nomenclature presents itself in such of the German
sword-dance rhymes as are in print. Three very similar versions
from Styria, Hungary, and Bohemia are traceable to a common
‘Austro-Bavarian’ archetype<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>. The names of these, so far as they
are intelligible at all, appear to be due to the village imagination,
working perhaps in one or two instances, such as ‘Grünwald’ or ‘Wilder
Waldmann,’ upon stock figures of the folk festivals<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>. It is the
heroic element, however, which predominates in the two other sets of
verses which are available. One is from the Clausthal in the Harz
mountains, and here the dancers represent the five kings of England,
Saxony, Poland, Denmark, and Moorland, together with a serving-man,
Hans, and one Schnortison, who acts as leader and treasurer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
party<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>. In the other, from Lübeck, the dancers are the ‘worthies’
Kaiser Karl, Josua, Hector, David, Alexander, and Judas Maccabaeus.
They fight with one Sterkader, in whom Müllenhoff finds the Danish hero
Stercatherus mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus; and to the Hans of the
Clausthal corresponds a Klas Rugebart, who seems to be the red-bearded
St. Nicholas<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>.</p>

<p>In view of the wide range of the sword-dance in Germany, I do not think
it is necessary to attach any importance to the theories advanced by
Sir Walter Scott and others that it is, in England and Scotland, of
Scandinavian origin. It is true that it appears to be found mainly
in those parts of these islands where the influence of Danes and
Northmen may be conjectured to have been strongest. But I believe that
this is a matter of appearance merely, and that a type of folk-dance
far more widely spread in the south of England than the sword-dance
proper, is really identical with it. This is the morris-dance, the
chief characteristic of which is that the performers wear bells which
jingle at every step. Judging by the evidence of account-books, as
well as by the allusions of contemporary writers, the morris was
remarkably popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>.
Frequently, but by no means always, it is mentioned in company with the
May-game<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>. In a certain painted window at Betley in Staffordshire
are represented six morris-dancers, together with a May-pole, a
musician, a fool, a crowned man on a hobby-horse, a crowned lady
with a pink in her hand, and a friar. The last three may reasonably
be regarded as Robin Hood, Maid Marian, and Friar Tuck<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>. The
closeness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span> of the relation between the morris-dance and the May-game
is, however, often exaggerated. The Betley figures only accompany the
morris-dance; they do not themselves wear the bells. And besides the
window, the only trace of evidence that any member of the Robin Hood
<i>cortège</i>, with the exception of Maid Marian, was essential to
the morris-dance, is a passage in a masque of Ben Jonson’s, which so
seems to regard the friar<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>. The fact is that the morris-dance was
a great deal older, as an element in the May-game, than Robin Hood,
and that when Robin Hood’s name was forgotten in this connexion, the
morris-dance continued to be in vogue, not at May-games only, but at
every form of rustic merry-making. On the other hand, it is true that
the actual dancers were generally accompanied by grotesque personages,
and that one of these was a woman, or a man dressed in woman’s clothes,
to whom literary writers at least continued to give the name of Maid
Marian. The others have nothing whatever to do with Robin Hood. They
were a clown or fool, and a hobby-horse, who, if the evidence of an
Elizabethan song can be trusted, was already beginning to go out of
fashion<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>. A rarer feature was a dragon, and it is possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span> that,
when there was a dragon, the rider of the hobby-horse was supposed to
personate St. George<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. The morris-dance is by no means extinct,
especially in the north and midlands. Accounts of it are available
from Lancashire and Cheshire<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>, Derbyshire<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>,
    Shropshire<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>,
Leicestershire<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>,
    and Oxfordshire<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span> and there are many other
counties in which it makes, or has recently made, an appearance<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>.
The hobby-horse, it would seem, is now at last, except in Derbyshire,
finally ‘forgot’; but the two other traditional grotesques are still
<i>de rigueur</i>. Few morris-dances are complete without the ‘fool’
or clown, amongst whose various names that of ‘squire’ in Oxfordshire
and that of ‘dirty Bet’ in Lancashire are the most interesting. The
woman is less invariable. Her Tudor name of Maid Marian is preserved in
Leicestershire alone; elsewhere she appears as a shepherdess, or Eve,
or ‘the fool’s wife’; and sometimes she is merged with the ‘fool’ into
a single nondescript personage.</p>

<p>The morris-dance is by no means confined to England. There are
records of it from Scotland<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>, Germany<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>,
    Flanders<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>,
Switzerland<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>, Italy<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>,
    Spain<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>, and France<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>. In the
last-named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> country Tabourot described it about 1588 under the name
of <i>morisque</i><a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>, and the earlier English writers call it
the <i>morisce</i>, <i>morisk</i>, or <i>morisco</i><a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>. This
seems to imply a derivation of the name at least from the Spanish
<i>morisco</i>, a Moor. The dance itself has consequently been held to
be of Moorish origin, and the habit of blackening the face has been
considered as a proof of this<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>. Such a theory seems to invert
the order of facts. The dance is too closely bound up with English
village custom to be lightly regarded as a foreign importation; and I
would suggest that the faces were not blackened, because the dancers
represented Moors, but rather the dancers were thought to represent
Moors, because their faces were blackened. The blackened face is common
enough in the village festival. Hence, as we have seen, May-day became
proper to the chimney-sweeps, and we have found a conjectural reason
for the disguise in the primitive custom of smearing the face with the
beneficent ashes of the festival fire<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>. Blackened faces are known
in the sword-dance as well as in the morris-dance<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>; and there are
other reasons which make it probable that the two are only variants
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span> same performance. Tabourot, it is true, distinguishes <i>les
bouffons</i>, or the sword-dance, and <i>le morisque</i>; but then
Tabourot is dealing with the sophisticated versions of the folk-dances
used in society, and Cotgrave, translating <i>les buffons</i>, can find
no better English term than <i>morris</i> for the purpose<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. The two
dances appear at the same festivals, and they have the same grotesques;
for the Tommy and Bessy of the English sword-dance, who occasionally
merge in one, are obviously identical with the Maid Marian and the
‘fool’ of the morris-dance, who also nowadays similarly coalesce.
There are traces, too, of an association of the hobby-horse with the
sword-dance, as well as with the morris-dance<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>. Most conclusive
of all, however, is the fact that in Oxfordshire and in Shropshire
the morris-dancers still use swords or wooden staves which obviously
represent swords, and that the performers of the elaborate Revesby
sword-dance or play, to be hereafter described, are called in the
eighteenth-century manuscript ‘morrice dancers<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>.’ I do not think
that the floating handkerchiefs of the morris-dance are found in its
congener, nor do I know what, if any, significance they have. Probably,
like the ribbons, they merely represent rustic notions of ornament.
Müllenhoff lays stress on the white shirts or smocks which he finds
almost universal in the sword-dance<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>. The morris-dancers are often
described as dressed in white; but here too, if the ordinary work-a-day
costume is a smock, the festal costume is naturally a clean white
smock. Finally, there are the bells. These, though they have partially
disappeared in the north, seem to be proper to the morris-dance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span> and
to differentiate it from the sword-dance<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>. But this is only so when
the English examples are alone taken into consideration, for Müllenhoff
quotes one Spanish and three German descriptions of sword-dances in
which the bells are a feature<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>. Tabourot affords similar evidence
for the French version<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>; while Olaus Magnus supplements his account
of the Scandinavian sword-dance with one of a similar performance, in
which the swords were replaced by bows, and bells were added<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>. The
object of the bells was probably to increase or preserve the musical
effect of the clashing swords. The performers known to Tacitus were
<i>nudi</i>, and no bells are mentioned. One other point with regard
to the morris-dance is worth noticing before we leave the subject. It
is capable of use both as a stationary and a processional dance, and
therefore illustrates both of the two types of dancing motion naturally
evolved from the circumstances of the village festival<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>.</p>

<p>Müllenhoff regards the sword-dance as primarily a rhythmic
<i>Abbild</i> or mimic representation of war, subsequently modified
in character by use at the village feasts<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>. It is true that the
notice of Tacitus and the allusion in <i>Beowulf</i> suggest that it
had a military character; and it may fairly be inferred that it formed
part of that war-cult from which, as pointed out in a previous chapter,
heroic poetry sprang. This is confirmed by the fact that some at least
of the <i>dramatis personae</i> of the modern dances belong to the
heroic category. Side by side with local types such as the Pitman or
the Sailor, and with doublets of the grotesques such as Little Foxey or
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span> Squire’s Son<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>, appear the five kings of the Clausthal dance,
the ‘worthies’ of the Lübeck dance, and the ‘champions of Christendom’
of the Shetland dance. These particular groups betray a Renaissance
rather than a mediaeval imagination; as with the morris-dance of
<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, the village schoolmaster, Holophernes
or another, has probably been at work upon them<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>. Some of the
heterogeneous English <i>dramatis personae</i>, Nelson for instance,
testify to a still later origin. On the other hand, the Sterkader
or Stercatherus of the Lübeck dance suggests that genuine national
heroes were occasionally celebrated in this fashion. At the same time
I do not believe, with Müllenhoff, that the sword-dance originated
in the war-cult. Its essentially agricultural character seems to be
shown by the grotesques traditionally associated with it, the man in
woman’s clothes, the skin or tail-wearing clown and the hobby-horse,
all of which seem to find their natural explanation in the facts of
agricultural worship<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>. Again, the dance makes its appearance, not
like heroic poetry in general as part of the minstrel repertory, but
as a purely popular thing at the agricultural festivals. To these
festivals, therefore, we may reasonably suppose it to have originally
belonged, and to have been borrowed from them by the young warriors
who danced before the king. They, however, perhaps gave it the heroic
element which, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> its turn, drifted into the popular versions. We have
already seen that popular heroic <i>cantilenae</i> existed together
with those of minstrelsy up to a late date. Nor does Müllenhoff’s view
find much support from the classical sword-dances which he adduces.
As to the origin of the <i>lusus Troiae</i> or Pyrrhic dance which
the Romans adopted from Doric Greece, I can say nothing<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>; but the
native Italian dance of the <i>Salii</i> or priests of Mars in March
and October is clearly agricultural. It belongs to the cult of Mars,
not as war-god, but in his more primitive quality of a fertilization
spirit<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>.</p>

<p>Further, I believe that the use of swords in the dance was not martial
at all; their object was to suggest not a fight, but a mock or
symbolical sacrifice. Several of the dances include figures in which
the swords are brought together in a significant manner about the
person of one or more of the dancers. Thus in the Scandinavian dance
described by Olaus Magnus, a <i>quadrata rosa</i> of swords is placed
on the head of each performer. A precisely similar figure occurs in
the Shetland and in a variety of the Yorkshire dances<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. In the
Siebenbürgen dances there are two figures in which the performers
pretend to cut at each other’s heads or feet, and a third in which one
of them has the swords put in a ring round his neck<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>. This latter
evolution occurs also in a variety of the Yorkshire dance<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> and in
a Spanish one described by Müllenhoff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> after a seventeenth-century
writer. And here the figure has the significant name of <i>la
degollada</i>, ‘the beheading<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.’</p>

<p>The <i>degollada</i> figures of certain sword-dances preserve with
some clearness the memory of an actual sacrifice, abolished and
replaced by a mere symbolic dumb show. Even in these, and still more
in the other dances, the symbolism is very slight. It is completely
subordinated to the rhythmic evolutions of a choric figure. There is an
advance, however, in the direction of drama, when in the course of the
performance some one is represented as actually slain. In a few dances
of the type discussed in the last chapter, such a dramatic episode
precedes or follows the regular figures. It is recorded in three or
four of the German examples<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>. A writer in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> describes a Yorkshire dance in which ‘the Bessy interferes
while they are making a hexagon with their swords, and is killed.’
Amongst the characters of this dance is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span> a Doctor, and although the
writer does not say so, it may be inferred that the function of the
Doctor is to bring the Bessy to life again<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>. It will be remembered
that a precisely similar device is used in the German Shrove Tuesday
plays to symbolize the resurrection of the year in spring after its
death in winter. The Doctor reappears in one of the Durham dances, and
here there is no doubt as to the part he plays. At a certain point the
careful formations of the dance degenerate into a fight. The parish
clergyman rushes in to separate the combatants. He is accidentally
slain. There is general lamentation, but the Doctor comes forward, and
revives the victim, and the dance proceeds<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>.</p>

<p>It is but a step from such dramatic episodes to the more elaborate
performances which remain to be considered in the present chapter, and
which are properly to be called plays rather than dances. They belong
to a stage in the evolution of drama from dance, in which the dance
has been driven into the background and has sometimes disappeared
altogether. But they have the same characters, and especially the same
grotesques, as the dances, and the general continuity of the two sets
of performances cannot be doubted. Moreover, though the plays differ
in many respects, they have a common incident, which may reasonably be
taken to be the central incident, in the death and revival, generally
by a Doctor, of one of the characters. And in virtue of this central
incident one is justified in classing them as forms of a folk-drama in
which the resurrection of the year is symbolized.</p>

<p>I take first, on account of the large amount of dancing which remains
in it, the play acted at the end of the eighteenth century by ‘The Plow
Boys or Morris Dancers’ of Revesby in Lincolnshire<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>. There are
seven dancers: six men, the Fool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span> and his five sons, Pickle Herring,
Blue Breeches, Pepper Breeches, Ginger Breeches, and Mr. Allspice<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>;
and one woman, Cicely. The somewhat incoherent incidents are as
follows. The Fool acts as presenter and introduces the play. He fights
successively a Hobby-horse and a ‘Wild Worm’ or dragon. The dancers
‘lock their swords to make the glass,’ which, after some jesting, is
broken up again. The sons determine to kill the Fool. He kneels down
and makes his will, with the swords round his neck<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>; is slain and
revived by Pickle Herring stamping with his foot. This is repeated with
variations. Hitherto, the dancers have ‘footed it’ round the room at
intervals. Now follow a series of sword-dances. During and after these
the Fool and his sons in turn woo Cicely, the Fool taking the name of
‘Anthony<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>,’ Pickle Herring that of ‘the Lord of Pool,’ and Blue
Breeches that of ‘the Knight of Lee.’ There is nothing particularly
interesting about this part of the play, obviously written to ‘work in’
the woman grotesque. In the course of it a morris-dance is introduced,
and a final sword-dance, with an obeisance to the master of the house,
winds up the whole.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are the Plough Monday plays of the east Midlands<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>.
These appear in Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span> and Lincolnshire.
Two printed versions are available. The first comes from Cropwell in
Nottinghamshire<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>. The actors are ‘the plough-bullocks.’ The male
characters are Tom the Fool, a Recruiting Sergeant, and a Ribboner or
Recruit, three farm-servants, Threshing Blade, Hopper Joe<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>, and the
Ploughman, a Doctor, and Beelzebub<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>. There are two women, a young
Lady and old Dame Jane. Tom Fool is presenter. The Ribboner, rejected
by the young Lady, enlists as a recruit. The Lady is consoled by Tom
Fool. Then enter successively the three farm-servants, each describing
his function on the farm. Dame Jane tries to father a child on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span> Tom
Fool. Beelzebub knocks her down<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>, and kills her. The Doctor comes
in, and after some comic business about his travels, his qualifications
and his remedies<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>, declares Dame Jane to be only in a trance, and
raises her up. A country dance and songs follow, and the performance
ends with a <i>quête</i>. The second version, from Lincolnshire, is
very similar<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>. But there are no farm-servants, and instead of
Beelzebub is a personage called ‘old Esem Esquesem,’ who carries a
broom. It is he, not an old woman, who is killed and brought to life.
There are several dancers, besides the performers; and these include
‘Bessy,’ a man dressed as a woman, with a cow’s tail.</p>

<p>The distinction between a popular and a literary or heroic type of
personification which was noticeable in the sword-dances persists in
the folk-plays founded upon them. Both in the Revesby play and in the
Plough Monday plays, the drama is carried on by personages resembling
the ‘grotesques’ of the sword-and morris-dances<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>. There are no
heroic characters. The death is of the nature of an accident or an
execution. On the other hand, in the ‘mummers’ play’ of St. George, the
heroes take once more the leading part, and the death, or at least one
of the deaths, is caused by a fight amongst them. This play is far more
widely spread than its rivals. It is found in all parts of England, in
Wales, and in Ireland; in Scotland it occurs also, but here some other
hero is generally substituted as protagonist for St. George<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
following account is based on the twenty-nine versions, drawn from
chap-books or from oral tradition, enumerated in the bibliographical
note. The list might, doubtless, be almost indefinitely extended. As
will soon be seen, the local variations of the play are numerous. In
order to make them intelligible, I have given in full in an appendix
a version from Lutterworth in Leicestershire. This is chosen, not as
a particularly interesting variant, for that it is not, but on the
contrary as being comparatively colourless. It shows very clearly and
briefly the normal structure of the play, and may be regarded as the
type from which the other versions diverge<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>.</p>

<p>The whole performance may be divided, for convenience of analysis,
into three parts, the Presentation, the Drama, the <i>Quête</i>.
In the first somebody speaks a prologue, claiming a welcome from
the spectators<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>, and then the leading characters are in turn
introduced. The second consists of a fight followed by the intervention
of a doctor to revive the slain. In the third some supernumerary
characters enter, and there is a collection. It is the dramatic
nucleus that first requires consideration. The leading fighter is
generally St. George, who alone appears in all the versions. Instead
of ‘St. George,’ he is sometimes called ‘Sir George,’ and more
often ‘Prince George’ or ‘King George,’ modifications which one
may reasonably suppose to be no older than the present Hanoverian
dynasty. At Whitehaven and at Falkirk he is ‘Prince George of Ville.’
George’s chief opponent is usually one of two personages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span> who are not
absolutely distinct from each other<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>. One is the ‘Turkish Knight,’
of whom a variant appears to be the ‘Prince of Paradine’ (Manchester),
or ‘Paradise’ (Newport, Eccleshall), perhaps originally ‘Palestine.’
He is sometimes represented with a blackened face<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>. The other is
variously called ‘Slasher,’ ‘Captain Slasher,’ ‘Bold Slasher,’ or,
by an obvious corruption, ‘Beau Slasher.’ Rarer names for him are
‘Bold Slaughterer’ (Bampton), ‘Captain Bluster’ (Dorset [A]), and
‘Swiff, Swash, and Swagger’ (Chiswick). His names fairly express his
vaunting disposition, which, however, is largely shared by the other
characters in the play. In the place of, or as minor fighters by the
side of George, the Turkish Knight and Bold Slasher, there appear,
in one version or another, a bewildering variety of personages, of
whom only a rough classification can be attempted. Some belong to the
heroic cycles. Such are ‘Alexander’ (Newcastle, Whitehaven), ‘Hector’
(Manchester), ‘St. Guy’ (Newport), ‘St. Giles’ (Eccleshall)<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>, ‘St.
Patrick’ (Dorset [A], Wexford), ‘King Alfred’ and ‘King Cole’ (Brill),
‘Giant Blunderbore’ (Brill), ‘Giant Turpin’ (Cornwall). Others again
are moderns who have caught the popular imagination: ‘Bold Bonaparte’
(Leigh)<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>, and ‘King of Prussia’ (Bampton, Oxford)<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>, ‘King
William’ (Brill), the ‘Duke of Cumberland’ (Oxford) and the ‘Duke of
Northumberland’ (Islip), ‘Lord Nelson’ (Stoke Gabriel, Devon)<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>,
‘Wolfe’ and ‘Wellington’ (Cornwall)<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>, even the ‘Prince Imperial’
(Wilts)<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>, all have been pressed into the service. In some cases
characters have lost their personal names, if they ever had any,
and figure merely as ‘Knight,’ ‘Soldier,’ ‘Valiant Soldier,’ ‘Noble
Captain,’ ‘Bold Prince,’ ‘Gracious King.’ Others bear names which defy
explanation, ‘Alonso’ (Chiswick), ‘Hy Gwyer’ (Hollington),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> ‘Marshalee’
and ‘Cutting Star’ (Dorset [B]). The significance of ‘General
Valentine’ and ‘Colonel Spring’ (Dorset [A]) will be considered
presently; and ‘Room’ (Dorset [B]), ‘Little Jack,’ the ‘Bride’ and
the ‘Fool’ (Brill), and the ‘King of Egypt’ (Newcastle, Whitehaven)
have strayed in amongst the fighters from the presenters. The fighting
generally takes the form of a duel, or a succession of duels. In the
latter case, George may fight all comers, or he may intervene to subdue
a previously successful champion. But an important point is that he
is not always victorious. On the contrary, the versions in which he
slays and those in which he is slain are about equal in number. In
two versions (Brill, Steyning) the fighting is not a duel or a series
of duels, but a <i>mêlée</i>. The Brill play, in particular, is quite
unlike the usual type. A prominent part is taken by the Dragon, with
whom fight, all at once, St. George and a heterogeneous company made
up of King Alfred and his Bride, King Cole, King William, Giant
Blunderbore, Little Jack and a morris-dance Fool.</p>

<p>Whatever the nature of the fight, the result is always the same. One or
more of the champions falls, and then appears upon the scene a Doctor,
who brings the dead to life again. The Doctor is a comic character. He
enters, boasting his universal skill, and works his cure by exhibiting
a bolus, or by drawing out a tooth with a mighty pair of pliers. At
Newbold he is ‘Dr. Brown,’ at Islip ‘Dr. Good’ (also called ‘Jack
Spinney’), at Brill ‘Dr. Ball’; in Dorsetshire (A) he is an Irishman,
‘Mr. Martin’ (perhaps originally ‘Martyr’) ‘Dennis.’ More often he is
nameless. Frequently the revival scene is duplicated; either the Doctor
is called in twice, or one cure is left to him, and another is effected
by some other performer, such as St. George (Dorset [B]), ‘Father
Christmas’ (Newbold, Steyning), or the Fool (Bampton).</p>

<p>The central action of the play consists, then, in these two episodes
of the fight and the resurrection; and the protagonists, so to speak,
are the heroes—a ragged troop of heroes, certainly—and the Doctor.
But just as in the sword-dances, so in the plays, we find introduced,
besides the protagonists, a number of supernumerary figures. The nature
of these, and the part they take, must now be considered. Some of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
are by this time familiar. They are none other than the grotesques
that have haunted this discussion of the village festivals from the
very beginning, and that I have attempted to trace to their origin in
magical or sacrificial custom. There are the woman, or lad dressed in
woman’s clothes, the hobby-horse, the fool, and the black-faced man.
The woman and the hobby-horse are unmistakable; the other two are a
little more Protean in their modern appearance. The ‘Fool’ is so called
only at Manchester and at Brill, where he brings his morris-dance with
him. At Lutterworth he is the ‘Clown’; in Cornwall, ‘Old Squire’; at
Newbold, ‘Big Head and Little Wits.’ But I think that we may also
recognize him in the very commonly occurring figure ‘Beelzebub,’ also
known in Cornwall as ‘Hub Bub’ and at Chiswick as ‘Lord Grubb.’ The
key to this identification is the fact that in several cases Beelzebub
uses the description ‘big head and little wit’ to announce himself on
his arrival. Occasionally, however, the personality of the Fool has
been duplicated. At Lutterworth Beelzebub and the Clown, at Newbold
Beelzebub and Big Head and Little Wits appear in the same play<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>.
The black-faced man has in some cases lost his black face, but he
keeps it at Bampton, where he is ‘Tom the Tinker,’ at Rugby, where he
is ‘Little Johnny Sweep,’ and in a Sussex version, where he is also a
sweep<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>. The analogy of the May-day chimney-sweeps is an obvious
one. A black face was a feature in the mediaeval representation of
devils, and the sweep of some plays is probably in origin identical
with the devil, black-faced or not, of others. This is all the more
so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> as the devil, like the sweep, usually carries a besom<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>. One
would expect <i>his</i> name, and not the Fool’s, to be Beelzebub. He
is, however, ‘Little Devil Dout’ or ‘Doubt,’ ‘Little Jack Doubt’ or
‘Jack Devil Doubt.’ At Leigh Little Devil Doubt also calls himself
‘Jack,’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘With my wife and family on my back’;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and perhaps we may therefore trace a further avatar of this same
personage in the ‘John’ or ‘Johnny Jack’ who at Salisbury gives a name
to the whole performance<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>. He is also ‘Little Jack’ (Brill, St.
Mary Bourne), ‘Fat Jack’ (Islip), ‘Happy Jack’ (Berkshire, Hollington),
‘Humpty Jack’ (Newbold). He generally makes the remark about his wife
and family. What he does carry upon his back is sometimes a hump,
sometimes a number of rag-dolls. I take it that the hump came first,
and that the dolls arose out of Jack’s jocular explanation of his own
deformity. But why the hump? Was it originally a bag of soot? Or the
<i>saccus</i> with which the German <i>Knechte Ruperte</i> wander
in the Twelve nights?<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> At Hollington and in a Hampshire version
Jack has been somewhat incongruously turned into a press-gang. In
this capacity he gets at Hollington the additional name of ‘Tommy
Twing-twang.’</p>

<p>Having got these grotesques, traditional accompaniments of the play, to
dispose of somehow, what do the playwrights do with them? The simplest
and most primitive method is just to bring them in, to show them to the
spectators when the fighting is over. Thus Beelzebub, like the Fool at
one point in the Revesby play, often comes in with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Here come I; ain’t been yit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Big head and little wit.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Ain’t been yit!’ Could a more naïve explanation of the presence of
a ‘stock’ character on the stage be imagined?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span> Similarly in Cornwall
the woman is worked in by making ‘Sabra,’ a <i>persona muta</i>, come
forward to join St. George<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>. In the play printed in <i>Sharpe’s
London Magazine</i> the ‘Hobby-horse’ is led in. Obviously personages
other than the traditional four can be introduced in the same way,
at the bidding of the rustic fancy. Thus at Bampton ‘Robin Hood’ and
‘Little John’ briefly appear, in both the Irish plays and at Tenby
‘Oliver Cromwell,’ at Belfast ‘St. Patrick,’ at Steyning the ‘Prince of
Peace.’</p>

<p>Secondly, the supernumeraries may be utilized, either as presenters
of the main characters or for the purposes of the <i>quête</i> at the
end. Thus at Leigh the performance is begun by Little Devil Doubt, who
enters with his broom and sweeps a ‘room’ or ‘hall’ for the actors,
just as in the sword-dances a preliminary circle is made with a sword
upon the ground<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>. In the Midlands this is the task of the woman,
called at Islip and in Berkshire ‘Molly,’ and at Bright-Walton ‘Queen
Mary<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>.’ Elsewhere the business with the broom is omitted; but there
is nearly always a short prologue in which an appeal is made to the
spectators for ‘room.’ This prologue may be spoken, as at Manchester by
the Fool, or as at Lutterworth by one of the fighters. The commonest
presenter, however, is a personification of the festal season at which
the plays are usually performed, ‘Old Father Christmas.’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Here comes I, Father Christmas, welcome or welcome not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hope Old Father Christmas will never be forgot.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At St. Mary Bourne Christmas is accompanied by ‘Mince-Pie,’ and
in both the Dorset versions, instead of calling for ‘room,’ he
introduces ‘Room’ as an actual personage. Similarly, at Newport and
Eccleshall, the prologue speaker receives the curious soubriquet of
‘Open-the-Door.’ After the prologue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> the fighters are introduced.
They stand in a clump outside the circle, and in turns step forward
and strut round it<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. Each is announced, by himself or by his
predecessor or by the presenter, with a set of rhymes closely parallel
to those used in the sword-dances. With the fighters generally
comes the ‘King of Egypt’ (occasionally corrupted into the ‘King of
England’), and the description of St. George often contains an allusion
to his fight with the dragon and the rescue of Sabra, the King of
Egypt’s daughter. In one or two of the northern versions (Newcastle,
Whitehaven) the King of Egypt is a fighter; generally he stands by. In
one of the Dorset versions (A) he is called ‘Anthony.’ Sabra appears
only in Cornwall, and keeps silence. The Dragon fights with St.
George in Cornwall, and also, as we have seen, in the curious Brill
<i>mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>The performance, naturally, ends with a <i>quête</i>. This takes
various forms. Sometimes the presenter, or the whole body of actors,
comes forward, and wishes prosperity to the household. Beelzebub, with
his frying-pan or ladle, goes round to gather in the contributions. In
the version preserved in <i>Sharpe’s London Magazine</i>, this is the
function of a special personage, ‘Boxholder.’ In a considerable number
of cases, however, the <i>quête</i> is preceded by a singular action on
the part of Little Devil Dout. He enters with his broom, and threatens
to sweep the whole party out, or ‘into their graves,’ if money is not
given. In Shropshire and Staffordshire he sweeps up the hearth, and the
custom is probably connected with the superstition that it is unlucky
to remove fire or ashes from the house on Christmas Day. ‘Dout’ appears
to be a corruption of ‘Do out<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>.’</p>

<p>Another way of working in the grotesques and other supernumeraries
is to give them minor parts in the drama itself. Father Christmas or
the King of Egypt is utilized as a sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> of chorus, to cheer on the
fighters, lament the vanquished, and summon the Doctor. At Newbold the
woman, called ‘Moll Finney,’ plays a similar part, as mother of the
Turkish Knight. At Stoke Gabriel, Devon, the woman is the Doctor’s
wife<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>. Finally, in three cases, a complete subordinate dramatic
episode is introduced for their sake. At Islip, after the main drama
is concluded, the presenter Molly suddenly becomes King George’s wife
‘Susannah.’ She falls ill, and the Doctor’s services are requisitioned
to cure her. The Doctor rides in, not on a hobby-horse, but on one of
the disengaged characters who plays the part of a horse. In Dorsetshire
the secondary drama is quite elaborate. In the ‘A’ version ‘Old Bet’
calls herself ‘Dame Dorothy,’ and is the wife of Father Christmas,
named, for the nonce, ‘Jan.’ They quarrel about a Jack hare, which
he wants fried and she wants roasted. He kills her, and at the happy
moment the Doctor is passing by, and brings her to life again. Version
‘B’ is very similar, except that the performance closes by Old Bet
bringing in the hobby-horse for Father Christmas to mount.</p>

<p>I do not think that I need further labour the affiliation of the
St. George plays to the sword-dances. Placed in a series, as I have
placed them in these chapters, the two sets of performances show a
sufficiently obvious continuity. They are held together by the use
of the swords, by their common grotesques, and by the episode of the
Doctor, which connects them also with the German Shrovetide and Whitsun
folk-ceremonies. They are properly called folk-drama, because they are
derived, with the minimum of literary intervention, from the dramatic
tendencies latent in folk-festivals of a very primitive type. They
are the outcome of the instinct of play, manipulating for its own
purposes the mock sacrifice and other débris of extinct ritual. Their
central incident symbolizes the <i>renouveau</i>, the annual death
of the year or the fertilization spirit and its annual resurrection
in spring<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>. To this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span> have become attached some of those heroic
<i>cantilenae</i> which, as the early mediaeval chroniclers tell
us, existed in the mouths of the <i>chori iuvenum</i> side by side
with the <i>cantilenae</i> of the minstrels. The symbolism of the
<i>renouveau</i> is preserved unmistakably enough in the episode of the
Doctor, but the <i>cantilenae</i> have been to some extent modified by
the comparatively late literary element, due perhaps to that universal
go-between of literature and the folk, the village school-master. The
genuine national heroes, a Stercatherus or a Galgacus, have given
way to the ‘worthies’ and the ‘champions of Christendom,’ dear to
Holophernes. The literary tradition has also perhaps contributed
to the transformation of the <i>chorus</i> or semi-dramatic dance
into drama pure and simple. In the St. George plays dancing holds
a very subordinate place, far more so than in the ‘Plow-boys’ play
of Revesby. Dances and songs are occasionally introduced before the
<i>quête</i>, but rarely during the main performance. In the eccentric
Brill version, however, a complete morris-dance appears. And of course
it must be borne in mind that the fighting itself, with its gestures
and pacings round the circle and clashing of swords, has much more
the effect of a sword-dance than of a regular fight. So far as it is
a fight, the question arises whether we ought to see in it, besides
the heroic element introduced by the <i>cantilenae</i>, any trace
of the mimic contest between winter and summer, which is found here
and there, alternating with the resurrection drama, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span> a symbolical
representation of the <i>renouveau</i>. The fight does not, of course,
in itself stand in any need of such an explanation; but it is suggested
by a singular passage which in several versions is put in the mouth of
one or other of the heroes. St. George, or the Slasher, or the Turkish
Knight, is made to boast something as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘My arms are made of iron, my body’s made of steel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My head is made of beaten brass, no man can make me feel.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It does not much matter who speaks these words in the versions of
Holophernes, but there are those who think that they originally
belonged to the representative of winter, and contained an allusion to
the hardness of the frost-bound earth<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>. Personally I do not see why
they should refer to anything but the armour which a champion might
reasonably be supposed to wear.</p>

<p>A curious thing about the St. George play is the width of its range.
All the versions, with the possible exception of that found at Brill,
seem to be derived from a common type. They are spread over England,
Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and only in the eastern counties do they
give way to the partly, though not wholly, independent Plough Monday
type. Unfortunately, the degeneracy of the texts is such that any
closer investigation into their inter-relations or into the origin and
transmission of the archetype would probably be futile. Something,
however, must be said as to the prominence, at any rate outside
Scotland, of the character of St. George. As far as I can see, the
play owes nothing at all to John Kirke’s stage-play of <i>The Seven
Champions of Christendom</i>, printed in 1638<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>. It is possible,
however, that it may be a development of a sword-dance in which, as
in the Shetland dance, the ‘seven champions’ had usurped the place of
more primitive heroes. If so the six champions, other than St. George,
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span> singularly vanished<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>. In any case, there can have been no
‘seven champions,’ either in sword-dance or mummers’ play, before
Richard Johnson brought together the scattered legends of the national
heroes in his <i>History of the Seven Champions</i> in 1596<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>.
This fact presents no difficulty, for the archetype of our texts need
certainly not be earlier than the seventeenth century<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>. By this
time the literary dramatic tradition was fully established, even in the
provinces, and it may well have occurred to Holophernes to convert the
sword-dance into the semblance of a regular play.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the mediaeval period had its dramatic or
semi-dramatic performances in which St. George figured, and possibly it
is to these, and not to the ‘seven champions,’ that his introduction
into the sword-dance is due. These performances generally took the
form of a ‘riding’ or procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span> on St. George’s day, April 23. Such
ridings may, of course, have originally, like the Godiva processions
or the midsummer shows, have preserved the memory of the pre-Christian
perambulations of the fields in spring, but during the period for
which records are available they were rather municipal celebrations
of a semi-ecclesiastical type. St. George was the patron saint of
England, and his day was honoured as one of the greater feasts, notably
at court, where the chivalric order of the Garter was under his
protection<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>. The conduct of the ridings was generally, from the end
of the fourteenth century onwards, in the hands of a guild, founded
not as a trade guild, but as a half social, half religious fraternity,
for the worship of the saint, and the mutual aid and good fellowship
of its members. The fullest accounts preserved are from Norwich where
the guild or company of St. George was founded in 1385, received a
charter from Henry V in 1416, and by 1451 had obtained a predominant
share in the government of the city<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>. The records of this guild
throw a good deal of light on the riding. The brethren and ‘sustren’
had a chapel in the choir of the cathedral, and after the Reformation
held their feasts in a chapel of the common hall of the city, which
had formerly been the church of a Dominican convent. The riding was
already established by 1408 when the court of the guild ordered that
‘the George shall go in procession and make a conflict with the Dragon
and keep his estate both days.’ The George was a man in ‘coat armour
beaten with silver,’ and had his club-bearer, henchmen, minstrels and
banners. He was accompanied by the Dragon, the guild-priest, and the
court and brethren of the guild in red and white capes and gowns. The
procession went to ‘the wood’ outside the city, and here doubtless the
conflict with the dragon took place. By 1537 there had been added to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> <i>dramatis personae</i> St. Margaret, also called ‘the lady,’
who apparently aided St. George in his enterprise<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>. Strange to
say, the guild survived the Reformation. In 1552, the court ordered,
‘there shall be neither George nor Margaret, but for pastime the
dragon to come and show himself, as in other years.’ But the feast
continued, and in spite of an attempt to get rid of him under the Long
Parliament, the Dragon endured until 1732 when the guild was dissolved.
Eighteenth-century witnesses describe the procession as it then
existed. The Dragon was carried by a man concealed in its body. It was
of basket work and painted cloth, and could move or spread its wings,
and distend or contract its head. The ranks were kept by ‘whifflers’
who juggled with their swords, and by ‘Dick Fools,’ in motley and
decked with cats’ tails and small bells. There is one more point of
interest about the Norwich guild. In the fifteenth century it included
many persons of distinction in Norfolk. Sir John Fastolf gave it an
‘angell silver and guylt.’ And amongst the members in 1496 was Sir John
Paston. I have already quoted the lament in the <i>Paston Letters</i>
over William Woode, the keeper, whom the writer ‘kepyd thys iij yer to
pleye Seynt Jorge and Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Nottyngham,’ and
who at a critical moment went off to Bernysdale and left his master in
the lurch<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>. I have also identified his Robin Hood play, and now it
becomes apparent where he played ‘Seynt Jorge.’ It is curious how the
fragments of the wreckage of time fit into one another. The riding of
the George is not peculiar to Norwich. We find it at Leicester<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>,
at Coventry<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>,
    at Stratford<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
    at Chester<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>, at York, at
Dublin<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>. An elaborate programme for the Dublin procession is
preserved. It included an emperor and empress with their train, St.
George on horse-back, the dragon led by a line and the king and queen
of Dele. But no princess is mentioned. The ‘may’ or maiden figured at
York, however, and there was also a St. Christopher. At other places,
such as Reading, Aston<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> and Louth<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>, an equestrian figure,
called a ‘George,’ is known to have stood on a ‘loft’ in the church,
and here, too, an annual ‘riding’ may be presumed.</p>

<p>There is no proof that the dramatic element in these ‘ridings’ was
anything more than a <i>mystère mimé</i>, or pageant in dumb show. On
the other hand, there were places where the performance on St. George’s
day took the form of a regular miracle-play. The performance described
by Collier as taking place before Henry V and the Emperor Sigismund at
Windsor in 1416 turns out on examination of Collier’s authority to be
really a ‘soteltie,’ a cake or raised pie of elaborate form. But the
town of Lydd had its St. George play in 1456, and probably throughout
the century; while in 1490 the chaplain of the guild of St. George at
New Romney went to see this Lydd play with a view to reproducing it at
the sister town. In 1511 again a play of St. George is recorded to have
been held at Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire, not on St. George’s, but
on St. Margaret’s day<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the subject-matter of all these pageants and miracles was
provided by the familiar ecclesiastical legend of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> St. George the
dragon-slayer, with which was occasionally interwoven the parallel
legend of St. Margaret<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>. Similar performances can be traced on
the continent. There was one at Mons called <i>le lumeçon</i><a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>.
Rabelais describes one at Metz, of which, however, the hero was not
St. George, but yet another dragon-slayer, St. Clement<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>. There is
no need to ascribe to them a folk origin, although the dragon-slaying
champion is a common personage in folk-tale<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>. They belong to the
cycle of religious drama, which is dealt with in the second volume of
this book. And although in Shropshire at least they seem to have been
preserved in a village stage-play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> up to quite a recent date<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>, they
obviously do not directly survive in the folk-play with which we are
concerned. As far as I know, that nowhere takes place on St. George’s
day. The Dragon is very rarely a character, and though St. George’s
traditional exploit is generally mentioned, it is, as that very mention
shows, not the motive of the action. On the other hand the legend, in
its mediaeval form, has no room for the episode of the Doctor<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>.
At the same time the Dragon does sometimes occur, and the traditional
exploit is mentioned, and therefore if any one chooses to say that
the fame of St. George in the guild celebrations as well as the fame
of the ‘seven champions’ romance determined his choice as the hero of
the later sword-dance rhymes, I do not see that there is much to urge
against the view<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to the main drift of this chapter, the criticism presents
itself; if the folk-plays are essentially a celebration of the
<i>renouveau</i> of spring, how is it that the performances generally
take place in mid-winter at Christmas? The answer is that, as will
be shown in the next chapter, none of the Christmas folk-customs are
proper to mid-winter. They have been attracted by the ecclesiastical
feast from the seasons which in the old European calendar preceded and
followed it, from the beginning of winter and the beginning of summer
or spring. The folk-play has come with the rest. But the transference
has not invariably taken place. The Norfolk versions belong not to
Christmas but to Plough Monday, which lies immediately outside the
Christmas season proper, and is indeed, though probably dislocated from
its primitive date, the earliest of the spring feasts. The St. George
play itself is occasionally performed at Easter, and even perhaps on
May-day, whilst versions, which in their present form contain clear
allusions to Christmas, yet betray another origin by the title which
they bear of the ‘Pace-eggers’’ or ‘Pasque-eggers’’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> play<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>.
Christmas, however, has given to the play the characteristic figure
of Old Father Christmas. And the players are known as ‘mummers’ and
‘guisers,’ or, in Cornwall, ‘geese-dancers,’ because their performance
was regarded as a variety of the ‘mumming’ or ‘disguising’ which,
as we shall see, became a regular name for the Christmas revel or
<i>quête</i><a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>.</p>

<p>So far this study has concerned itself, on the one hand with the
general character of the peasant festivals, on the other with the
special history of such of these as fall within the summer cycle of the
agricultural year, from ploughing to harvest. The remaining chapters
will approach the corresponding festivals, centring around Christmas,
of winter. These present a somewhat more difficult problem, partly
because their elements are not quite so plainly agricultural, partly
because of the remarkable dislocations which the development and clash
of civilizations have brought about.</p>

<p>It must, I think, be taken as established that the Germano-Keltic
tribes had no primitive mid-winter feast, corresponding directly to
the modern Christmas<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. They had no solstitial feast, for they knew
nothing of the solstices. And although they had a winter feast of the
dead, belonging rather to the domestic than to the elemental side of
cult, this probably fell not at the middle, but at the beginning of the
season. It was an aspect in the great feast with which not the winter
only but the Germano-Keltic year began. This took place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> when the
advance of snow and frost drove the warriors back from foray and the
cattle from the pastures. The scarcity of fodder made the stall-feeding
of the whole herd an impossibility, and there was therefore an economic
reason for a great slaughtering. This in its turn led to a great
banquet on the fresh meat, and to a great sacrifice, accompanied with
the usual perambulations, water-rites and fire-rites which sacrifice
to the deities of field and flock entailed<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>. The vegetation spirit
would again be abroad, no longer, as in spring or summer, in the form
of flowers and fresh green boughs, but in that of the last sheaf or
‘kern-baby’ saved from harvest, or in that of such evergreens or rarer
blossoms as might chance to brave the snows. The particular ‘intention’
of the festival would be to secure the bounty of the divine powers for
the coming year, and a natural superstition would find omens for the
whole period in the events of the initial day. The feast, however,
would be domestic, as well as seasonal. The fire on the hearth was made
‘new,’ and beside it the fathers, resting from the toils of war, or
herding or tillage, held jollification with their children. Nor were
the dead forgotten. <i>Minni</i> were drunk in honour of ancestors and
ancestral deities; and a share of the banquet was laid out for such
of these as might be expected, in the whirl of the wintry storm, to
revisit the familiar house-place.</p>

<p>Originally, no doubt, the time of the feast was determined by the
actual closing of the war-ways and the pastures. Just as the first
violet or some migratory bird of March was hailed for the herald of
summer, so the first fall of snow gave the signal that winter was
at hand<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>. In the continental home of the Germano-Keltic tribes
amongst the forests of central Europe this would take place with
some regularity about the middle of November<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>. A fixed date for
the feast could only arise when, at some undefined time, the first
calendar, the ‘three-score-day-tide’ calendar of unknown origin, was
introduced<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> Probably it was thenceforward held regularly upon
a day corresponding to either November the 11th or the 12th in our
reckoning. If it is accurately represented by St. Martin’s day, it
was the 11th<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>, if by the Manx <i>Samhain</i>, the 12th<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. It
continued to begin the year, and also the first of the six tides into
which that year was divided. As good fortune will have it, the name
of that tide is preserved to us in the Gothic term <i>Iiuleis</i>
for November and December<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>, in the Anglo-Saxon <i>Giuli</i> or
<i>Geola</i> which, according to Bede, applied both to December and
to January<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>, and in <i>Yule</i>, the popular designation, both
in England and Scandinavia, of Christmas itself<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>. The meaning
of this name is, however, more doubtful. The older philology, with
solstices running in its brain, supposed that it applied primarily to a
mid-winter feast, and connected it with the Anglo-Saxon <i>hwéol</i>,
a wheel<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>. Bede himself, learned in Roman lore, seems to hint at
such an explanation<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>. The current modern explanation derives
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span> word from a supposed Germanic <i>jehwela</i>, equivalent to the
Latin <i>ioculus</i><a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>. It would thus mean simply a ‘feast’ or
‘rejoicing,’ and some support seems to be lent to this derivation
by the occasional use of the English ‘<i>yule</i>’ and the Keltic
<i>gwyl</i> to denote feasts other than that of winter<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>. Other
good authorities, however, prefer to trace it to a Germanic root
<i>jeula</i>-from which is derived the Old Norse <i>él</i>, ‘a
snowstorm’; and this also, so far as its application to the feast
and tide of winter is concerned, seems plausible enough<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>. It is
possible that to the winter feast originally belonged the term applied
by Bede to December 24 of <i>Modranicht</i> or <i>Modraneht</i><a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>.
It would be tempting to interpret this as ‘the night which gives birth
to the year’; but philologists say that it can only mean ‘night of
mothers,’ and we must therefore explain it as due to some cult of the
<i>Matres</i> or triad of mother-goddesses, which took place at the
feast<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>The subsequent history of the winter feast consists in its gradual
dislocation from the original mid-November position, and dispersion
over a large number of dates covering roughly the whole period between
Michaelmas and Twelfth night. For this process a variety of causes are
responsible. Some of these are economic. As civilization progressed,
mid-November came to be, less than of old, a signal turning-point in
the year. In certain districts to which the Germano-Keltic tribes
penetrated, in Gaul, for instance, or in Britain with its insular
climate, the winter tarried, and the regular central European closing
of the pastures was no longer a law. Then again tillage came gradually
to equal or outstrip pasturage in importance, and the year of tillage
closed, even in Germany, at the end of September rather than in
mid-November. The harvest feast began to throw the winter feast rather
into the shade as a wind-up of the year’s agricultural labours.
This same development of tillage, together with the more scientific
management of pasturage itself, did more. It provided a supply of
fodder for the cattle, and by making stall-feeding possible put off
further and further into the winter the necessity of the great annual
slaughter. The importance in Germany, side by side with St. Martin’s
day (November 11), of St. Andrew’s day (November 30), and still more
St. Nicholas’ day (December 6)<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>, as folk-feasts, seems to suggest a
consequent tendency to a gradual shifting of the winter festival.</p>

<p>These economic causes came gradually into operation throughout a
number of centuries. In displacing the November feast, they prepared
the way for and assisted the action of one still more important. This
was the influence of Roman usage. When the Germano-Keltic tribes
first came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span> contact with the Roman world, the beginning of the
Roman year was still, nominally at least, upon the Kalends, or first
of March. This did not, so far as I know, leave any traces upon the
practice of the barbarians<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>. In 45 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Julian
calendar replaced the Kalends of March by those of January. During
the century and a half that followed, Gaul became largely and Britain
partially Romanized, while there was a steady infiltration of Roman
customs and ideas amongst the German tribes about and even far beyond
the Rhine. With other elements of the southern civilization came the
Roman calendar which largely replaced the older Germanic calendar of
three-score-day-tides. The old winter festival fell in the middle of
a Roman month, and a tendency set in to transfer the whole or a part
of its customs either to the beginning of this month<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> or, more
usually, to the beginning of the Roman year, a month and a half later.
This process was doubtless helped by the fact that the Roman New Year
customs were not in their origin, or even at the period of contact,
essentially different from those of their more northerly cousins. It
remained, of course, a partial and incomplete one. In Gaul, where the
Roman influence was strongest, it probably reached its maximum. But in
Germany the days of St. Martin<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> and St. Nicholas<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> have fully
maintained their position as folk-feasts by the side of New Year’s day,
and even Christmas itself; while St. Martin’s day at least has never
been quite forgotten in our islands<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>. The state of transition is
represented by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span> isolated Keltic district known as the Isle of Man.
Here, according to Professor Rhys, the old <i>Samhain</i> or Hollantide
day of November 12 is still regarded by many of the inhabitants as
the beginning of the year. Others accept January 1; and there is
considerable division of opinion as to which is the day whereon the
traditional New Year observances should properly be held<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.</p>

<p>A final factor in the dislocation of the winter feast was the
introduction of Christianity, and in especial the establishment of
the great ecclesiastical celebration of Christmas. When Christianity
first began to claim the allegiance of the Roman world, the rulers of
the Church were confronted by a series of southern winter feasts which
together made the latter half of December and the beginning of January
into one continuous carnival. The nature and position of these feasts
claim a brief attention.</p>

<p>To begin with, there were the feasts of the Sun. The <i>Bruma</i>
(<i>brevissima</i>) or <i>Brumalia</i> was held on November 24, as the
day which ushered in the period of the year during which the sun’s
light is diminished. This seems to have been a beginning of winter
feast, adopted by Rome from Thrace<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>. The term <i>bruma</i> was
also sometimes applied to the whole period between November 24 and
the solstice, and ultimately even to the solstitial day itself, fixed
somewhat incorrectly by the Julian calendar on December 25<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>. On
this day also came a festival, which probably owed its origin to the
Emperor Aurelian (270-75), whose mother was a semi-Oriental priestess
of the Sun, in one of his Syrian forms as Baal or Belus<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>, and who
instituted an official cult of this divinity at Rome with a temple on
the Quirinal, a <i>collegium</i> of <i>pontifices</i>, and <i>ludi
circenses</i> held every fourth year<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>. These fell on the day of the
solstice, which from the lengthening of the sun’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> course was known
as the ‘birthday’ of <i>Sol Novus</i> or <i>Sol Invictus</i><a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>.
This cult was practised by Diocletian and by Constantine before his
conversion, and was the rallying-point of Julian in his reaction
against Christianity<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>. Moreover, the <i>Sol Invictus</i> was
identified with the central figure of that curious half-Oriental,
half-philosophical worship of Mithra, which at one time threatened to
become a serious rival to Christianity as the religion of the thinking
portion of the Roman world<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>. That an important Mithraic feast also
fell on December 25 can hardly be doubted, although there is no direct
evidence of the fact<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>.</p>

<p>The cult of the <i>Sol Invictus</i> was not a part of the ancient Roman
religion, and, like the <i>Brumalia</i>, the solstitial festival in his
honour, however important to the educated and official classes of the
empire, was not a folk-festival. It lay, however, exactly between two
such festivals. The <i>Saturnalia</i> immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> preceded it; a few
days later followed the January <i>Kalends</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Saturnalia</i>, so far as the religious feast of Saturn was
concerned, took place on December 17. Augustus, however, added two
days to the <i>feriae iudiciariae</i>, during which the law-courts
were shut, and popular usage extended the festival to seven. Amongst
the customs practised was that of the <i>sigillariorum celebritas</i>,
a kind of fair, at which the <i>sigillaria</i>, little clay dolls
or <i>oscilla</i>, were bought and given as presents. Originally,
perhaps, these <i>oscilla</i> were like some of our feasten cakes,
figures of dough. Candles (<i>cerei</i> or <i>candelae</i>) appear
also to have been given. On the second and third days it was customary
to bathe in the early morning<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>. But the chief characteristic of
the feast was the licence allowed to the lower classes, to freedmen
and to slaves. During the <i>libertas Decembris</i> both moral and
social restraints were thrown off<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>. Masters made merry with their
servants, and consented for the time to be on a footing of strict
equality with them<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>. A <i>rex Saturnalitius</i>, chosen by lot, led
the revels, and was entitled to claim obedience for the most ludicrous
commands<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>The similarity of the <i>Saturnalia</i> to the folk-feasts of western
Europe will be at once apparent. The name <i>Saturnus</i> seems to
point to a ploughing and sowing festival, although how such a festival
came to be held in mid-December must be matter of conjecture<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>.
The <i>Kalends</i>, on the other hand, are clearly a New Year
festival. They began on January 1, with the solemn induction of the
new consuls into office. As in the case of the <i>Saturnalia</i>,
the <i>feriae</i> lasted for more than one day, covering at least a
<i>triduum</i>. The third day was the day of <i>vota</i> or solemn
wishes of prosperity for the New Year to the emperor. The houses were
decked with lights and greenery, and once more the masters drank and
played dice with their slaves. The resemblance in this respect between
the <i>Kalends</i> and the <i>Saturnalia</i> was recognized by a myth
which told how when Saturn came bringing the gifts of civilization to
Italy he was hospitably received by Janus, who then reigned in the
land<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>. Another Kalends custom, the knowledge of which we owe to the
denunciations of the Fathers, was the parading of the city by bands
of revellers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span> dressed in women’s clothes or in the skins of animals.
And, finally, a series of superstitious observances testified to the
belief that the events of the first day of the year were ominous for
those of the year itself. A table loaded all night long with viands
was to ensure abundance of food; such necessaries of life as iron and
fire must not be given or lent out of the house, lest the future supply
of them should fail. To this order of ideas belonged, ultimately at
least, if not originally, the central feature of the whole feast, the
<i>strenae</i> or presents so freely exchanged between all classes of
society on the Kalends. Once, so tradition had it, the <i>strenae</i>
were nothing more than twigs plucked from the grove of the goddess
Strenia, associated with Janus in the feast<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>; but in imperial times
men gave honeyed things, that the year of the recipient might be full
of sweetness, lamps that it might be full of light, copper and silver
and gold that wealth might flow in amain<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Fathers were not slow to protest against these feasts,
and, in particular, against the participation in them of professing
Christians. Tertullian is, as usual, explicit and emphatic in his
condemnation<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>. The position was aggravated when, probably in the
fourth century, the Christian feast of the Birthday of Christ came to
be fixed upon December 25, in the very heart of the pagan rejoicings
and upon the actual day hitherto sacred to <i>Sol Invictus</i>. The
origin of Christmas is wrapped in some obscurity<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>. The earliest
notices of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span> celebration of the birth of Christ in the eastern Church
attach it to that of his baptism on the Epiphany. This feast is as old
as the second century. By the fourth it was widespread in the East,
and was known also in Gaul and probably in northern Italy<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>. At
Rome it cannot be traced so early; but it was generally adopted there
by the beginning of the fifth, and Augustine blames the Donatists for
rejecting it, and so cutting themselves off from fellowship with the
East<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>. Christmas, on the other hand, made its appearance first at
Rome, and the East only gradually and somewhat grudgingly accepted it.
The Paulician Christians of Armenia to this day continue to feast the
birth and the baptism together on January 6, and to regard the normal
Christian practice as heretical. An exact date for the establishment of
the Roman feast cannot be given, for the theory which ascribed it to
Pope Liberius in 353 has been shown to be baseless<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>. But it appears
from a document of 336 that the beginning of the liturgical year then
already fell between December 8 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span> 27<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>. Christmas may, therefore,
be assumed to have been in existence at least by 336.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that the fourth century witnessed the
establishment, both at Rome and elsewhere, of Christmas and Epiphany
as two distinct feasts, whereas only one, although probably not
everywhere the same one, had been known before. This fact is hardly to
be explained by a mere attempt to accommodate varying local uses. The
tradition of the Armenian doctors, who stood out against Christmas,
asserts that their opponents removed the birthday of Christ from
January 6 out of ‘disobedience<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>.’ This points to a doctrinal reason
for the separate celebration of the birth and the baptism. And such a
reason may perhaps be found in the Adoptionist controversies. The joint
feast appeared to lend credence to the view, considered a heresy, but
still adhered to by the Armenian Church, that Christ was God, not from
his mother’s womb, but only from his adoption or spiritual birth at
the baptism in Jordan. It was needful that orthodox Christians should
celebrate him as divine from the very moment of his carnal birth<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>.</p>

<p>The choice of December 25 as the day for the Roman feast cannot be
supposed to rest upon any authentic tradition as to the historic
date of the Nativity. It is one of several early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span> patristic guesses
on the subject. It is not at all improbable that it was determined
by an attempt to adopt some of the principal Christian festivals to
the solstices and equinoxes of the Roman calendar<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>. The enemies
of Roman orthodoxy were not slow to assert that it merely continued
under another name the pagan celebration of the birthday of <i>Sol
Invictus</i><a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>. Nor was the suggestion entirely an empty one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
The worshippers of <i>Sol Invictus</i>, and in particular the
Mithraic sect, were not quite on the level of the ordinary pagans by
tradition. Mithraism had claims to be a serious and reasonable rival
to Christianity, and if its adherents could be induced by argument
to merge their worship of the physical sun in that of the ‘Sun of
Righteousness,’ they were well worth winning<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>. On the other hand
there were obvious dangers in the Roman policy which were not wholly
averted, and we find Leo the Great condemning certain superstitious
customs amongst his flock which it is difficult to distinguish from
the sun-worship practised alike by pagans and by Saint Augustine’s
heretical opponents, the Manichaeans<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>From Rome the Christmas feast gradually made its way over East and
West. It does not seem to have reached Jerusalem until at least the
sixth century, and, as we have seen, the outlying Church of Armenia
never adopted it. But it was established at Antioch about 375 and
at Alexandria about 430<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>. At Constantinople an edict of 400
included it in the list of holy days upon which <i>ludi</i> must not
be held<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>. In 506 the council of Agatha recognized the Nativity as
one of the great days of the Christian year<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>, while fasting on
that day was forbidden by the council of Braga in 561 as savouring of
Priscillianist heresy<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. The feast of the Epiphany, meanwhile, was
relegated to a secondary place; but it was not forgotten, and served as
a celebration, in addition to the baptism, of a number of events in the
life of Christ, which included the marriage at Cana and the feeding of
the five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span> thousand, and of which the visit of the <i>Magi</i> gradually
became the leading feature. The <i>Dodecahemeron</i>, or period of
twelve days, linking together Christmas and Epiphany, was already
known to Ephraim Syrus as a festal tide at the end of the fourth
century<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>, and was declared to be such by the council of Tours in
567<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>.</p>

<p>To these islands Christmas came, if not with the Keltic Church, at
least with St. Augustine in 592. On Christmas day, 598, more than ten
thousand English converts were baptized<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>, and by the time of Bede
(†734) Christmas was established, with Epiphany and Easter, as one
of the three leading festivals of the year<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>. The <i>Laws</i> of
Ethelred (991-1016) and of Edward the Confessor ordain it a holy tide
of peace and concord<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>. Continental Germany received it from the
synod of Mainz in 813<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>, while Norway owed it to King Hakon the Good
in the middle of the tenth century<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>.</p>

<p>Side by side with the establishment of Christmas proceeded the
ecclesiastical denunciation of those pagan festivals whose place it was
to take. Little is heard in Christian times of the <i>Saturnalia</i>,
which do not seem to have shared the popularity of the Kalends outside
the limits of Rome itself. But these latter, and especially the
Kalends, are the subject of attack in every corner of the empire.
Jerome of Rome, Ambrose of Milan, Maximus of Turin, Chrysologus of
Ravenna, assail them in Italy; Augustine in Africa; Chrysostom and
Asterius and the Trullan council in the East. In Spain, Bishop Pacian
of Barcelona made a treatise upon one of the most objectionable
features of the festival which, as he says with some humour, probably
tended to increase its vogue. In Gaul, Caesarius of Arles initiated
a vigorous campaign. To cite all the ecclesiastical pronouncements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
on the subject would be tedious. Homily followed homily, canon
followed canon, capitulary followed capitulary, penitential followed
penitential, for half a thousand years. But the Kalends died hard.
When Boniface was tackling them amongst the Franks in the middle of
the eighth century, he was sorely hampered by the bad example of
their continued prevalence at the very gates of the Vatican; and when
Burchardus was making his collection of heathen observances in the
eleventh century, those of the Kalends were still to be included.
In England there is not much heard of them, but a reference in the
so-called <i>Penitential of Egbert</i> about 766 proves that they
were not unknown. It need hardly be said that all formal religious
celebration of the Kalends disappeared with the official victory of
Christianity. But this element had never been of great importance in
the feast; and the terms in which the ecclesiastical references from
beginning to end are couched prove that they relate mainly to popular
New Year customs common to the Germanic and the more completely
Latinized populations<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>.</p>

<p>It appears from a decree of the council of Tours in 567 that,
<i>ad calcandam Gentilium consuetudinem</i>, the fourth-century
Fathers established on the first three days of January a
<i>triduum ieiunii</i>, with litanies, in spite of the fact that
these days fell in the very midst of the festal period of the
<i>Dodecahemeron</i><a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>. At the same time January 1 was kept as the
octave of Christmas, and the early Roman ritual-books show two masses
for that day, one <i>in octavis Domini</i>, the other <i>ad prohibendum
ab idolis</i>. The Jewish custom by which circumcision took place
eight days after birth made it almost inevitable that there should be
some celebration of the circumcision of Christ upon the octave of his
Nativity. This was the case from the sixth century, and ultimately,
about the eighth, the attempt to keep up a fast on January 1 was
surrendered, and the festival of the Circumcision took its place<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>.</p>

<p>Some tendency was shown by the Church not merely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span> set up Christmas
as a rival to the pagan winter feasts, but also to substitute it
for the Kalends of January as the beginning of the year. But the
innovation never affected the civil year, and was not maintained even
by ecclesiastical writers with any consistency, for even they prefer
in many cases a year dating from the Annunciation, or more rarely
from Easter. The so-called Annunciation style found favour even for
many civil purposes in Great Britain, and was not finally abandoned
until 1753<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>. But although Christmas cannot be said to have ever
become a popular New Year’s day, yet its festal importance and its
propinquity to January 1 naturally led to a result undesired and
possibly undreamt of by its founders, namely, the further transference
to it of many of the long-suffering Germano-Keltic folk-customs, which
had already travelled under Roman influence from the middle of November
to the beginning of January<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>. Already in the sixth century it had
become necessary to forbid the abuses which had gathered around the
celebration of Christmas eve<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>; and the Christmas customs of to-day,
even where their name does not testify to their original connexion with
the Kalends<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>, are in a large number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> cases, so far of course as
they are not simply ecclesiastical, merely doublets of those of the New
Year.</p>

<p>What is true of Christmas is true also of Epiphany or Twelfth night;
and the history of the other modern festivals of the winter cycle
is closely parallel. The old Germanic New Year’s day on November 11
became the day of St. Martin, a fourth-century bishop of Tours, and the
<i>pervigiliae</i> of St. Martin, like those of the Nativity itself,
already caused a scandal in the sixth century<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>. The observances
of the deferred days of slaughter clustered round the feasts of St.
Andrew on November 30, and more especially St. Nicholas on December 6.
The <i>Todtenfest</i>, which had strayed to the beginning of November,
was continued in the feasts of All Saints or Hallowmas, the French
<i>Toussaint</i>, on November 1, and its charitable supplement of All
Souls, on November 2. That which had strayed still further to the time
of harvest became the <i>Gemeinwoche</i> or week-wake, and ultimately
St. Michael and All Angels. Nor is this all. Very similar customs
attached themselves to the minor feasts of the <i>Dodecahemeron</i>,
St. Stephen’s, St. John the Evangelist’s, Innocents’ days, to the
numerous dedication wakes that fell on days, such as St. Luke’s<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>,
in autumn or early winter, or to the miscellaneous feasts closely
approaching the Christmas season, St. Clement’s, St. Catherine’s, St.
Thomas’s, with which indeed in many localities that season is popularly
supposed to begin<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>. Nor was this process sensibly affected by the
establishment in the sixth century of the <i>ieiunium</i> known as
Advent, which stretched for a <i>Quadragesima</i>, or period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span> of forty
days, from Martinmas onwards. And finally, just as in May village
dipping customs attached themselves in the seventeenth century to Royal
Oak day, so in the same century we find the winter festival fires
turned to new account in the celebration of the escape of King and
Parliament from the nefarious machinations of Guy Fawkes.</p>

<p>It is the outcome of the last chapter that all the folk-customs of
the winter half of the year, from Michaelmas to Plough Monday, must
be regarded as the flotsam and jetsam of a single original feast.
This was a New Year’s feast, held by the Germano-Keltic tribes at the
beginning of the central European winter when the first snows fell
about the middle of November, and subsequently dislocated and dispersed
by the successive clash of Germano-Keltic civilization with the rival
schemes of Rome and of Christianity. A brief summary of the customs
in question will show clearly their common character. For purposes of
classification they may be divided into several groups. There are such
customs belonging to the agricultural side of the old winter feast as
have not been transferred with the growing importance of tillage to
the feast of harvest. There are the customs of its domestic side, as
a feast of the family hearth and of the dead ancestors. There are the
distinctively New Year customs of omen and prognostication for the
approaching twelve months. There are the customs of play, common more
or less to all the village festivals. And, finally, there are a small
number of customs, or perhaps it would be truer to say legends, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
appear to owe their origin not merely to heathenism transformed by
Christianity, but to Christianity itself. Each of these groups may well
claim a more thoroughgoing consideration than can here be given to any
one of them.</p>

<p>The agricultural customs are just those of the summer feasts over
again. Once more the fertilization spirit is abroad in the land.
The embodiment of it in vegetation takes several forms. Obviously
the last foliage and burgeoning flowers of spring and summer are no
longer available. But there is, to begin with, the sheaf of corn or
‘harvest-May’ in which the spirit appeared at harvest, and which is
called upon once more to play its part in the winter rites. This,
however, is not a very marked part. A Yorkshire custom of hanging a
sheaf on the church door at Christmas is of dubious origin<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>. But
Swedish and Danish peasants use the grain of the ‘last sheaf’ to bake
the Christmas cake, and both in Scandinavia and Germany the ‘Yule
straw’ serves various superstitious purposes. It is scattered on barren
fields to make them productive. It is strewed, instead of rushes, upon
the house floor and the church floor. It is laid in the mangers of the
cattle. Fruit-trees are tied together with straw ropes, that they may
bear well and are said to be ‘married<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>.’</p>

<p>More naturally the fertilization spirit may be discerned at the
approach of winter in such exceptional forms of vegetation as endure
the season. In November the apples and the nuts still hang upon their
boughs, and these are traditional features in the winter celebrations.
Then there are the evergreens. Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom
tell how on the Kalends the doors of houses throughout the Roman empire
were crowned with bay. Martin of Braga forbade the ‘pagan observance’
in a degree which found its way into the canon law. The original
<i>strena</i> which men gave one another on the same day for luck
was nothing but a twig plucked from a sacred grove; and still in the
fifth century men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> returned from their new year auguries laden with
<i>ramusculi</i> that they might thereafter be laden with wealth<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>.
It is not necessary to dwell upon the surviving use of evergreens in
the decoration at Christmas of houses and churches<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>. The sacredness
of these is reflected in the taboo which enjoins that they shall not
be cast out upon the dust-heap, but shall, when some appropriate day,
such as Candlemas, arrives, be solemnly committed to the flames<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>.
Obviously amongst other evergreens the holly and the ivy, with their
clustering pseudo-blossoms of coral and of jet, are the more adequate
representatives of the fertilization spirit<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>; most of all the
mistletoe, perched an alien visitant, faintly green and white, amongst
the bared branches of apple or of oak. The mistletoe has its especial
place in Scandinavian myth<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>: Pliny records the ritual use of it
by the Druids<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>; it is essential to the winter revels in their
amorous aspect; and its vanished dignities still serve, here to bar
it from, there to make it imperative in, the edifices of Christian
worship<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>. A more artificial embodiment of the fertilization spirit
is the ‘Christmas tree’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span> <i>par excellence</i>, adorned with lights
and apples, and often with a doll or image upon the topmost sprig. The
first recorded Christmas tree is at Strassburg in 1604. The custom
is familiar enough in modern England, but there can be little doubt
that here it is of recent introduction, and came in, in fact, with the
Hanoverians<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there can be little wonder that the popular imagination found
a special manifestation of the fertilization spirit in the unusual
blossoming of particular trees or species of trees in the depths of
winter. In mild seasons a crab or cherry might well adorn the old
winter feast in November. A favourable climate permits such a thing
even at mid-winter. Legend, at any rate, has no doubt of the matter,
and connects the event definitely with Christmas. A tenth-century
Arabian geographer relates how all the trees of the forest stand in
full bloom on the holy night. In the thirteenth-century <i>Vita</i> of
St. Hadwigis the story is told of a cherry-tree. A fifteenth-century
bishop of Bamberg tells it of two apple-trees, and to apple-trees the
miracle belongs, in German folk-belief, to this day<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>. In England
the stories of Christmas-flowering hawthorns or blackthorns are
specific and probably not altogether baseless<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>. The belief found
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span> special location at Glastonbury, where the famous thorn is said by
William of Malmesbury and other writers to have budded from the staff
of Joseph of Arimathea, who there ended his wanderings with the Holy
Grail. Where winter-flowering trees are not found, a custom sometimes
exists of putting a branch of cherry or of hawthorn in water some
weeks before Christmas in order that it may blossom and serve as a
substitute<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>.</p>

<p>It may fairly be conjectured that at the winter, as at the summer
feast, the fertilization spirit, in the form of bush or idol, was
borne about the fields. The fifteenth-century writer, Alsso, records
the <i>calendisationes</i> of the god Bel in Bohemia, suppressed by
St. Adalbert<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>. In modern England, a ‘holly-bough’ or ‘wesley-bob,’
with or without an image or doll, occasionally goes its rounds<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>.
But a definite lustration of the bounds is rare<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>, and, for the most
part, the winter procession either is merely riotous or else, like
too many of the summer processions themselves, has been converted,
under the successive influence of the <i>strenae</i> and the cash
nexus, into little more than a <i>quête</i>. Thus children and the
poor go ‘souling’ for apples and ‘soul-cakes’ on All Souls’ day; on
November 5 they collect for the ‘guy’; on November 11 in Germany, if
not in England, for St. Martin; on St. Clement’s day (November 23)
they go ‘clemencing’; on St. Catherine’s (November 25) ‘catherning.’
Wheat is the coveted boon on St. Thomas’s day (December 21) or
‘doling day,’ and the <i>quête</i> is variously known as ‘thomasing,’
‘mumping,’ ‘corning,’ ‘gooding,’ ‘hodening,’ or ‘hooding<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>.’
Christmas brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> ‘wassailing’ with its bowl of lamb’s-wool and its
bobbing apple, and this is repeated on New Year’s day or eve<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>.
The New Year <i>quête</i> is probably the most widespread and popular
of all. Ducange records it at Rome<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>. In France it is known as
<i>l’Aguilaneuf</i><a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>, in Scotland and the north of England
as Hogmanay, terms in which the philologists meet problems still
unsolved<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. Other forms of the winter <i>quête</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span> will crop up
presently, and the visits of the guisers with their play or song, the
carol singers and the waits may be expected at any time during the
Christmas season. As at the summer <i>quêtes</i>, some reminiscence of
the primitive character of the processions is to be found in the songs
sung, with their wish of prosperity to the liberal household and their
ill-will to the churl<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>.</p>

<p>In the summer festivals both water-rites and fire-rites frequently
occur. In those of winter, water-rites are comparatively rare, as
might naturally be expected at a season when snow and ice prevail.
There is some trace, however, of a custom of drawing ‘new’ water, as
of making ‘new’ fire, for the new year<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>. Festival fires, on the
other hand, are widely distributed, and agree in general features with
those of summer. Their relation to the fertility of crop and herd is
often plainly enough marked. They are perhaps most familiar to-day
in the comparatively modern form of the Guy Fawkes celebration on
November 5<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>, but they are known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> also on St. Crispin’s day (October
25)<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>, Hallow e’en<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>,
    St. Martin’s day<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, St. Thomas’s
day<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>, Christmas eve<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>,
    New Year<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>, and Twelfth night<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>.
An elaborate and typical example is the ‘burning of the clavie’ at
the little fishing village of Burghead on the Moray Firth<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. This
takes place on New Year’s eve, or, according to another account<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>,
Christmas eve (O.S.). Strangers to the village are excluded from any
share in the ritual. The ‘clavie’ is a blazing tar-barrel hoisted on a
pole. In making it, a stone must be used instead of a hammer, and must
then be thrown away. Similarly, the barrel must be lit with a blazing
peat, and not with lucifer matches. The bearers are honoured, and the
bridegroom of the year gets the ‘first lift.’ Should a bearer stumble,
it portends death to himself during the year and ill-luck to the town.
The procession passes round the boundaries of Burghead, and formerly
visited every boat in the harbour. Then it is carried to the top of
a hillock called the ‘Doorie,’ down the sides of which it is finally
rolled. Blazing brands are used to kindle the house fires, and the
embers are preserved as charms.</p>

<p>The central heathen rite of sacrifice has also left its abundant
traces upon winter custom. Bede records the significant name of
<i>blôt-monath</i>, given to November by the still unconverted
Anglo-Saxons<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>. The tradition of solemn slaughter hangs around
both Martinmas and Christmas. ‘Martlemas beef’ in England, St.
Martin’s swine, hens, and geese in Germany, mark the former day<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>.
At Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> the outstanding victim seems to be the boar. <i>Caput
apri defero: reddens laudem Domino</i>, sings the taberdar at Queen’s
College, Oxford, as the manciple bears in the boar’s head to the
Christmas banquet. So it was sung in many another mediaeval and
Elizabethan hall<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>, while the gentlemen of the Inner Temple broke
their Christmas fast on ‘brawn, mustard, and malmsey<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>,’ and in the
far-off Orkneys each householder of Sandwick must slay his sow on St.
Ignace’s or ‘Sow’ day, December 17<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>. The older mythologists, with
the fear of solstices before their eyes, are accustomed to connect
the Christmas boar with the light-god, Freyr<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>. If the cult of any
one divinity is alone concerned, the analogous use of the pig in the
Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter would make the earth-goddess a more
probable guess<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. A few more recondite customs associated with
particular winter anniversaries may be briefly named. St. Thomas’s
day is at Wokingham the day for bull-baiting<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>. On St. Stephen’s
day, both in England and Germany, horses are let blood<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>. On or
about Christmas, boys are accustomed to set on foot a hunt of victims
not ordinarily destined to such a fate<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>; owls and squirrels, and
especially wrens, the last, be it noted, creatures which at other
times of the year a taboo protects. The wren-hunt is found on various
dates in France, England, Ireland, and the Isle of Man, and is carried
out with various curious rituals. Often the body is borne in a
<i>quête</i>, and in the Isle of Man the <i>quêteurs</i> give a feather
as an amulet in return for hospitality. There are other examples of
winter <i>quêtes</i>, in which the representation of a sacrificial
victim is carried round<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>. ‘Hoodening’ in Kent and other parts of
England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> is accompanied by a horse’s head or hobby-horse<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>. The
Welsh ‘Mari Lwyd’ is a similar feature<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>, while at Kingscote, in
Gloucestershire, the wassailers drink to a bull’s head called ‘the
Broad<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>.’</p>

<p>The hobby-horse is an example of an apparently grotesque element which
is found widespread in folk-processions, and which a previous chapter
has traced to its ritual origin. The man clad in a beast-skin is the
worshipper putting himself by personal contact under the influence
and protection of the sacrificed god. The rite is not a very salient
one in modern winter processions, although it has its examples, but
its historical importance is great. A glance at the ecclesiastical
denunciations of the Kalends collected in an appendix will disclose
numerous references to it. These are co-extensive with the western area
of the Kalends celebrations. In Italy, in Gaul, in southern Germany,
apparently also in Spain and in England, men decked themselves for
riot in the heads and skins of cattle and the beasts of the chase,
blackened their faces or bedaubed them with filth, or wore masks fit to
terrify the demons themselves. The accounts of these proceedings are
naturally allusive rather than descriptive; the fullest are given by
a certain Severian, whose locality and date are unknown, but who may
be conjectured to speak for Italy, by Maximus of Turin and Chrysologus
of Ravenna in the fifth century, and by Caesarius of Arles in the
beginning of the sixth. Amongst the <i>portenta</i> denounced is a
certain <i>cervulus</i>, which lingers in the <i>Penitentials</i> right
up to the tenth century, and with which are sometimes associated a
<i>vitula</i> or <i>iuvenca</i>. Caesarius adds a <i>hinnicula</i>,
and St. Eadhelm, who is my only authority for the presence of the
<i>cervulus</i> in England, an <i>ermulus</i>. These seem to be
precisely of the nature of ‘hobby-horses.’ Men are said <i>cervulum
ambulare</i>, <i>cervulum facere</i>, <i>in cervulo vadere</i>, and
Christians are forbidden to allow these <i>portenta</i> to come before
their houses. The <i>Penitential</i> of the Pseudo-Theodore tells us
that the performers were those who wore the skins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> and heads of beasts.
Maximus of Turin, and several writers after him, put the objection to
the beast-mimicry of the Kalends largely on the ground that man made
in the image of God must not transform himself into the image of a
beast. But it is clear that the real reason for condemning it was its
unforgettable connexion with heathen cult. Caesarius warns the culprit
that he is making himself into a <i>sacrificium daemonum</i>, and the
disguised reveller is more than once spoken of as a living image of
the heathen god or demon itself. There is some confusion of thought
here, and it must be remembered that the initial significance of the
skin-wearing rite was probably buried in oblivion, both for those who
practised it and for those who reprobated. But it is obvious that the
worshipper wearing a sacrificial skin would bear a close resemblance
to the theriomorphic or semi-theriomorphic image developed out of
the sacrificial skin nailed on a tree-trunk; and it is impossible
not to connect the fact that in the prohibitions a <i>cervulus</i>
or ‘hobby-buck’ rather than a ‘hobby-horse’ is prominent with the
widespread worship throughout the districts whence many of these
notices come of the mysterious stag-horned deity, the <i>Cernunnos</i>
of the Gaulish altars<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>. On the whole I incline to think that at
least amongst the Germano-Keltic peoples the agricultural gods were not
mimed in procession by human representatives. It is true that in the
mediaeval German processions which sprang out of those of the Kalends
St. Nicholas plays a part, and that the presence of St. Nicholas may
be thought to imply that of some heathen precursor. It will, however,
be seen shortly that St. Nicholas may have got into these processions
through a different train of ideas, equally connected with the Kalends,
but not with the strictly agricultural aspect of that festival. But of
the continuity of the beast-masks and other horrors of these Christmas
processions with those condemned in the prohibitions, there can be no
doubt<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a>. A few other survivals of the <i>cervulus</i> and its revel
can be traced in various parts of Europe<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>The sacrifices of cereals and of the juice of the vine or the barley
are exemplified, the one by the traditional furmenty, plum-porridge,
mince-pie, souling-cake, Yule-dough, Twelfth night cake, <i>pain de
calende</i>, and other forms of ‘feasten’ cake<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>; the other by
the wassail-bowl with its bobbing apple<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>. The summer ‘youling’
or ‘tree-wassailing’ is repeated in the orchard<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>, and a curious
Herefordshire custom represents an extension of the same principle to
the ox-byre<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>. A German hen-yard custom requires mixed corn, for
the familiar reason that every kind of crop must be included in the
sacrifice<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>.</p>

<p>Human sacrifice has been preserved in the whipping of boys on
Innocents’ day, because it could be turned into the symbol of a
Christian myth<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>. It is preserved also, as throughout the summer,
in the custom, Roman as well as Germano-Keltic, of electing a mock or
temporary king. Of such the Epiphany king or ‘king of the bean’ is,
especially in France, the best known<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>. Here again, the association
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> the three kings or <i>Magi</i> has doubtless prolonged his
sway. But he is not unparalleled. The <i>rex autumnalis</i> of Bath
is perhaps a harvest rather than a beginning of winter king<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>. But
the shoemakers choose their King Crispin on October 25, the day of
their patron saints, Crispin and Crispinian; on St. Clement’s (November
23) the Woolwich blacksmiths have their King Clem, and the maidens
of Peterborough and elsewhere a queen on St. Catherine’s (November
25). Tenby, again, elects its Christmas mock mayor<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>. At York, the
proclaiming of Yule by ‘Yule’ and ‘Yule’s wife’ on St. Thomas’s day
was once a notable pageant<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>. At Norwich, the riding of a ‘kyng of
Crestemesse’ was the occasion of a serious riot in 1443<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>. These may
be regarded as ‘folk’ versions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> mock king. Others, in which the
folk were less concerned, will be the subject of chapters to follow.</p>

<p>Before passing to a fresh group of Christmas customs, I must note the
presence of one more bit of ritual closely related to sacrificial
survivals. That is, the man masquerading in woman’s clothes, in whom we
have found a last faint reminiscence of the once exclusive supremacy
of women in the conduct of agricultural worship. At Rome, musicians
dressed as women paraded the city, not on the Kalends, but on the
Ides of January<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>. The Fathers, however, know such disguising as
a Kalends custom, and a condemnation of it often accompanies that of
beast-mimicry, from the fourth to the eighth century<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>.</p>

<p>The winter festival is thus, like the summer festivals, a moment in the
cycle of agricultural ritual, and is therefore shared in by the whole
village in common. It is also, and from the time of the institution
of harvest perhaps preeminently, a festival of the family and the
homestead. This side of it finds various manifestations. There is the
solemn renewal of the undying fire upon the hearth, the central symbol
and almost condition of the existence of the family as such. This
survives in the institution of the ‘Yule-log,’ which throughout the
Germano-Keltic area is lighted on Christmas or more rarely New Year’s
eve, and must burn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span> as local custom may exact, either until midnight,
or for three days, or during the whole of the Twelve-night period,
from Christmas to Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>. Dr. Tille, intent on magnifying the
Roman element in western winter customs, denies any Germano-Keltic
origin to the Christmas blaze, and traces it to the Roman practice of
hanging lamps upon the house-doors during the <i>Saturnalia</i> and the
Kalends<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>. It is true that the Yule-log is sometimes supplemented
or even replaced by the Christmas candle<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>, but I do not think that
there can be any doubt which is the primitive form of rite. And the
Yule-log enters closely into the Germano-Keltic scheme of festival
ideas. The preservation of its brands or ashes to be placed in the
mangers or mingled with the seed-corn suggests many and familiar
analogies. Moreover, it is essentially connected with the festival fire
of the village, from which it is still sometimes, and once no doubt was
invariably, lit, affording thus an exact parallel to the Germano-Keltic
practice on the occasion of summer festival fires, or of those built to
stay an epidemic.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the domestic character of the winter festival is
to be found in the prominent part which children take in it. As
<i>quêteurs</i>, they have no doubt gradually replaced the elder folk,
during the process through which, even within the historical purview,
ritual has been transformed into play. But St. Nicholas, the chief
mythical figure of the festival, is their patron saint; for their
benefit especially, the <i>strenae</i> or Christmas and New Year’s
gifts are maintained; and in one or two places it is their privilege,
on some fixed day during the season, to ‘bar out’ their parents or
masters<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the winter festival included a commemoration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> ancestors.
It was a feast, not only of riotous life, but of the dead. For, to
the thinking of the Germano-Keltic peoples, the dead kinsmen were
not altogether outside the range of human fellowship. They shared
with the living in banquets upon the tomb. They could even at times
return to the visible world and hover round the familiar precincts of
their own domestic hearth. The Germans, at least, heard them in the
gusts of the storm, and imagined for them a leader who became Odin.
From another point of view they were naturally regarded as under the
keeping of earth, and the earth-mother, in one aspect a goddess of
fertility, was in another the goddess of the dead. As such she was
worshipped under various names and forms, amongst others in the triad
of the <i>Matres</i> or <i>Matronae</i>. In mediaeval superstition she
is represented by Frau Perchte, Frau Holda and similar personages, by
Diana, by Herodias, by St. Gertrude, just as the functions of Odin
are transferred to St. Martin, St. Nicholas, St. John, Hellequin. It
was not unnatural that the return of the spirits, in the ‘wild hunt’
or otherwise, to earth should be held to take place especially at the
two primitive festivals which respectively began the winter and the
summer. Of the summer or spring commemoration but scant traces are
to be recovered<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>; that of winter survives, in a dislocated form,
in more than one important anniversary. Its observances have been
transferred with those of the agricultural side of the feast to the
<i>Gemeinwoche</i> of harvest<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span> but they are also retained, at or
about their original date, on All Saints’ and All Souls’ days<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>;
and, as I proceed to show, they form a marked and interesting part of
the Christmas and New Year ritual. I do not, indeed, agree with Dr.
Mogk, who thinks that the Germans held their primitive feast of the
dead in the blackest time of winter, for it seems to me more economical
to suppose that the observances in question have been shifted like
others from November to the Kalends. But I still less share the view
of Dr. Tille, who denies that any relics of a feast of the dead can be
traced in the Christmas season at all<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>.</p>

<p>Bede makes the statement that the heathen Anglo-Saxons gave to the eve
of the Nativity the name of <i>Modranicht</i> or ‘night of mothers,’
and in it practised certain ceremonies<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>. It is a difficult passage,
but the most plausible of various explanations seems to be that which
identifies these ceremonies with the cult of those <i>Matres</i> or
<i>Matronae</i>, corresponding with the Scandinavian <i>disar</i>,
whom we seem justified in regarding as guardians and representatives
of the dead. Nor is there any particular difficulty in guessing at the
nature of the ceremonies referred to. Amongst all peoples the cult
of the dead consists in feeding them; and there is a long catena of
evidence for the persistent survival in the Germano-Keltic area of a
Christmas and New Year custom closely parallel to the <i>alfablót</i>
and <i>disablót</i> of the northern <i>jul</i>. When the household went
to bed after the New Year revel, a portion of the banquet was left
spread upon the table in the firm belief that during the night the
ancestral spirits and their leaders would come and partake thereof.
The practice, which was also known on the Mediterranean, does not
escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span> the animadversion of the ecclesiastical prohibitions. The
earlier writers who speak of it, Jerome, Caesarius, Eligius, Boniface,
Zacharias, the author of the <i>Homilia de Sacrilegiis</i>, if they
give any explanation at all, treat it as a kind of charm<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>. The
laden table, like the human over-eating and over-drinking, is to
prognosticate or cause a year of plentiful fare. The preachers were
more anxious to eradicate heathenism than to study its antiquities.
Burchardus, however, had a touch of the anthropologist, and Burchardus
says definitely that food, drink, and three knives were laid on
the Kalends table for the three <i>Parcae</i>, figures of Roman
mythology with whom the western <i>Matres</i> or ‘weird sisters’ were
identified<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>. Mediaeval notices confirm the statement of Burchardus.
Martin of Amberg<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>, the <i>Thesaurus Pauperum</i><a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> and the
Kloster Scheyern manuscript<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> make the recipient of the bounty Frau
Perchte. In Alsso’s <i>Largum Sero</i> it is for the heathen gods or
demons<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>; in <i>Dives and Pauper</i> for ‘Atholde or Gobelyn<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>.’
In modern survivals it is still often Frau Perchte or the Perchten or
Persteln for whom fragments of food are left; in other cases the custom

<p>It is the ancestors, perhaps, who are really had in mind when libations
are made upon the Yule-log, an observance known to Martin of Braga in
the sixth century<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>, and still in use in France<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>. Nor can it
be doubted that the healths drunk to them, and to the first of them,
Odin, lived on in the St. John’s <i>minnes</i>, no less than in the
St. Martin’s <i>minnes</i>, of Germany<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>. Apart from eating and
drinking, numerous folk-beliefs testify to the presence of the spirits
of the dead on earth in the Twelve nights of Christmas. During these
days, or some one of them, Frau Holle and Frau Perchte are abroad<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>.
So is the ‘wild hunt<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>.’ Dreams then dreamt come true<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>, and
children then born see ghosts<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>. The werwolf, possessed by a human

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>The wanderings of Odin in the winter nights must be at the bottom of
the nursery myth that the Christian representatives of this divinity,
Saints Martin and Nicholas (the Santa Claus of modern legend), are
the nocturnal givers of <i>strenae</i> to children. In Italy, the
fairy Befana (Epiphania), an equivalent of Diana, has a similar
function<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>. It was but a step to the actual representation of
such personages for the greater delight of the children. In Anspach
the skin-clad <i>Pelzmarten</i>, in Holland St. Martin in bishop’s
robes, make their rounds on St. Martin’s day with nuts, apples, and
such-like<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>. St. Nicholas does the same on St. Nicholas’ day
in Holland and Alsace-Lorraine, at Christmas in Germany<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>. The
beneficent saints were incorporated into the Kalends processions
already described, which in the sixteenth-century Germany included
two distinct groups, a dark one of devils and beast-masks, terrible
to children, and a white or kindly one, in which sometimes appeared
the <i>Jesus-Kind</i> himself<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span> It is perhaps a relic of the same
merging which gives the German and Flemish St. Nicholas a black Moor as
companion in his nightly peregrinations<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the customs which form part of the agricultural or the domestic
observances of the winter feasts, there are others which belong to
these in their quality as feasts of the New Year. To the primitive mind
the first night and day of the year are full of omen for the nights
and days that follow. Their events must be observed as foretelling,
nay more, they must as far as possible be regulated as determining,
those of the larger period. The eves and days of All Saints, Christmas,
and the New Year itself, as well as in some degree the minor feasts,
preserve in modern folk-lore this prophetic character. It is but an
extension and systematization of the same notion that ascribes to each
of the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany a special influence
upon one of the twelve months of the year<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>. This group of customs
I can only touch most cursorily. The most interesting are those which,
as I have just said, attempt to go beyond foretelling and to determine
the arrival of good fortune. Their method is symbolic. In order that
the house may be prosperous during the year, wealth during the critical
day must flow in and not flow out. Hence the taboos which forbid the
carrying out in particular of those two central elements of early
civilization, fire<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> and iron<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>. Hence too the belief that a job
of work begun on the feast day will succeed, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> conflicts rather
curiously in practice with the universal rustic sentiment that to work
or make others work on holidays is the act of a churl<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>. Nothing,
again, is more important to the welfare of the household during the
coming year than the character of the first visitor who may enter
the house on New Year’s day. The precise requirements of a ‘first
foot’ vary in different localities; but as a rule he must be a boy
or man, and not a girl or woman, and he must be dark-haired and not
splay-footed<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>. An ingenious conjecture has connected the latter
requirements with the racial antagonism of the high-instepped dark
pre-Aryan to the flat-footed blonde or red-haired invading Kelt<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>.
A Bohemian parallel enables me to explain that of masculinity by the
belief in the influence of the sex of the ‘first foot’ upon that of
the cattle to be born during the year<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>. I regret to add that there
are traces also of a requirement that the ‘first foot’ should not be
a priest, possibly because in that event the shadow of celibacy would
make any births at all improbable<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the New Year observances are but prophetic by second intention,
having been originally elements of cult. An example is afforded by the
all-night table for the leaders of the dead, which, as has been pointed
out, was regarded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span> the Fathers who condemned it as merely a device,
with the festal banquet itself, to ensure carnal well-being. Another is
the habit of giving presents. This, though widespread, is apparently
of Italian and not Germano-Keltic origin<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>. It has gone through
three phases. The original <i>strena</i> played a part in the cult of
the wood-goddess. It was a twig from a sacred tree and the channel
of the divine influence upon the personality of him who held or wore
it. The later <i>strena</i> had clearly become an omen, as is shown
by the tradition which required it to be honeyed or light-bearing or
golden<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>. To-day even this notion may be said to have disappeared,
and the Christmas-box or <i>étrenne</i> is merely a token of goodwill,
an amusement for children, or a blackmail levied by satellites.</p>

<p>The number of minor omens by which the curiosity, chiefly of
women, strives on the winter nights to get a peep into futurity is
legion<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>. Many of them arise out of the ordinary incidents of the
festivities, the baking of the Christmas cakes<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>, the roasting of
the nuts in the Hallow-e’en fire<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>. Some of them preserve ideas of
extreme antiquity, as when a girl takes off her shift and sits naked
in the belief that the vision of her future husband will restore it to
her. Others are based upon the most naïve symbolism, as when the same
girl pulls a stick out of the wood-pile to see if her husband will be
straight or crooked<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>. But however diversified the methods, the
objects of the omens are few and unvarying. What will be the weather
and what his crops? How shall he fare in love and the begetting of
children? What are his chances of escaping for yet another year the
summons of the lord of shadows? Such are the simple questions to which
the rustic claims from his gods an answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Finally, the instinct of play proved no less enduring in the
Germano-Keltic winter feasts than in those of summer. The priestly
protests against the invasion of the churches by folk-dance and
folk-song apply just as much to Christmas as to any other festal
period. It is, indeed, to Christmas that the monitory legend of the
dancers of Kölbigk attaches itself. A similar pious narrative is
that in the thirteenth-century <i>Bonum Universale de Apibus</i> of
Thomas of Cantimpré, which tells how a devil made a famous song of
St. Martin, and spread it abroad over France and Germany<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>. Yet a
third is solemnly retailed by a fifteenth-century English theologian,
who professes to have known a man who once heard an indecent song at
Christmas, and not long after died of a melancholy<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>. During the
seventeenth century folk still danced and cried ‘Yole’ in Yorkshire
churches after the Christmas services<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>. Hopeless of abolishing
such customs, the clergy tried to capture them. The Christmas crib
was rocked to the rhythms of a dance, and such great Latin hymns as
the <i>Hic iacet in cunabulis</i> and the <i>Resonat in laudibus</i>
became the parents of a long series of festival songs, half sacred,
half profane<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>. In Germany these were known as <i>Wiegenlieder</i>,
in France as <i>noëls</i>, in England as carols; and the latter name
makes it clear that they are but a specialized development of those
<i>caroles</i> or <i>rondes</i> which of all mediaeval <i>chansons</i>
came nearest to the type of Germano-Keltic folk-song. A single passage
in a Byzantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span> writer gives a tantalizing glimpse of such a folk-revel
or <i>laiks</i> at a much earlier stage. Constantine Porphyrogennetos
describes amongst the New Year sports and ceremonies of the court of
Byzantium in the tenth century one known as τὸ Γοτθικόν. In this the
courtiers were led by two ‘Goths’ wearing skins and masks, and carrying
staves and shields which they clashed together. An intricate dance
took place about the hall, which naturally recalls the sword-dance of
western Europe. A song followed, of which the words are preserved. They
are only partly intelligible, and seem to contain allusions to the
sacrificial boar and to the Gothic names of certain deities. From the
fact that they are in Latin, the scholars who have studied them infer
that the Γοτθικόν drifted to Byzantium from the court of the great
sixth-century Ostrogoth, Theodoric<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—The best recent accounts of
the Feast of Fools as a whole are those of G. M. Dreves in
<i>Stimmen aus Maria-Laach</i> (1894), xlvii. 571, and Heuser
in Wetzer and Welte, <i>Kirchenlexicon</i> (ed. 2), iv. 1402,
s. v. <i>Feste</i> (2), and an article in <i>Zeitschrift
für Philosophie und katholische Theologie</i> (Bonn, 1850),
N. F. xi. 2. 161. There is also a summary by F. Loliée in
<i>Revue des Revues</i>, xxv (1898), 400. The articles by L.
J. B. Bérenger-Féraud in <i>Superstitions et Survivances</i>
(1896), vol. iv, and in <i>La Tradition</i>, viii. 153; ix.
1 are unscholarly compilations. A pamphlet by J. X. Carré de
Busserolle, published in 1859, I have not been able to see;
another, or a reprint of the same, was promised in his series
of <i>Usages singuliers de Touraine</i>, but as far as I know
never appeared. Of the older learning the interest is mainly
polemical in J. Deslyons, <i>Traitez singuliers et nouveaux
contre le Paganisme du Roy-boit</i> (1670); J. B. Thiers, <i>De
Festorum Dierum Imminutione</i> (1668), c. 48; <i>Traité des
Jeux et des Divertissemens</i> (1686), c. 33; and historical
in Du Tilliot, <i>Mémoires pour servir à l’Histoire de la Fête
des Foux</i> (1741 and 1751); F. Douce, in <i>Archaeologia</i>,
xv. 225; M. J. R[igollot] et C. L[eber], <i>Monnaies inconnues
des Évêques des Innocens, des Fous, &amp;c.</i> (1837). Vols. ix
and x of C. Leber, <i>Collection des meilleurs Dissertations,
&amp;c., relatifs à l’Histoire de France</i> (1826 and 1838),
contain various treatises on the subject, some of them, by the
Abbé Lebeuf and others, from the <i>Mercure de France</i>. A.
de Martonne, <i>La Piété du Moyen Âge</i> (1855), 202, gives
a useful bibliographical list. The collection of material in
Ducange’s <i>Glossary</i>, s.vv. <i>Deposuit</i>, <i>Festum
Asini</i>, <i>Kalendae</i>, &amp;c., is invaluable. Authorities of
less general range are quoted in the footnotes to this chapter:
the most important is A. Chérest’s account of the Sens feast
in <i>Bulletin de la Soc. des Sciences de l’Yonne</i> (1853),
vol. vii. Chérest used a collection of notes by E. Baluze
(1630-1718) which are in <i>MS. Bibl. Nat.</i> 1351 (cf. <i>Bibl.
de l’École des Chartes</i>, xxxv. 267). Dom. Grenier (1725-89)
wrote an account of the Picardy feasts, in his <i>Introduction
à l’Histoire de Picardie</i> (<i>Soc. des Antiquaires de
Picardie, Documens inédits</i> (1856), iii. 352). But many of his
<i>probata</i> remain in his <i>MSS. Picardie</i> in the <i>Bibl.
Nat.</i> (cf. <i>Bibl. de l’École des Chartes</i>, xxxii. 275).
Some of this material was used by Rigollot for the book named

<p>The New Year customs, all too briefly summed up in the last chapter,
are essentially folk customs. They belong to the ritual of that village
community whose primitive organization still, though obscurely,
underlies the complex society of western Europe. The remaining
chapters of the present volume will deal with certain modifications
and developments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span> introduced into those customs by new social classes
which gradually differentiated themselves during the Middle Ages from
the village folk. The churchman, the <i>bourgeois</i>, the courtier,
celebrated the New Year, even as the peasant did. But they put their
own temper into the observances; and it is worth while to accord a
separate treatment to the shapes which these took in such hands, and to
the resulting influence upon the dramatic conditions of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The discussion must begin with the somewhat startling New Year revels
held by the inferior clergy in mediaeval cathedrals and collegiate
churches, which may be known generically as the ‘Feast of Fools.’
Actually, the feast has different names in different localities.
Most commonly it is the <i>festum stultorum</i>, <i>fatuorum</i> or
<i>follorum</i>; but it is also called the <i>festum subdiaconorum</i>
from the highest of the <i>minores ordines</i> who, originally at
least, conducted it, and the <i>festum baculi</i> from one of its most
characteristic and symbolical ceremonies; while it shares with certain
other rites the suggestive title of the ‘Feast of Asses,’ <i>asinaria
festa</i>.</p>

<p>The main area of the feast is in France, and it is in France that it
must first of all be considered. I do not find a clear notice of it
until the end of the twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>. It is mentioned, however,
in the <i>Rationale Divinorum Officium</i> (†1182-90) of Joannes
Belethus, rector of Theology at Paris, and afterwards a cathedral
dignitary at Amiens. ‘There are four <i>tripudia</i>’ Belethus tells
us, ‘after Christmas. They are those of the deacons, priests, and
choir-children, and finally that of the sub-deacons, <i>quod vocamus
stultorum</i>, which is held according to varying uses, on the
Circumcision, or on Epiphany, or on the octave of Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>.’
Almost simultaneously the feast can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span> be traced in the cathedral of
Notre-Dame at Paris, through an epigram written by one Leonius, a
canon of the cathedral, to a friend who was about to pay him a visit
for the <i>festum baculi</i> at the New Year<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>. The <i>baculus</i>
was the staff used by the precentor of a cathedral, or whoever might
be conducting the choir in his place<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>. Its function in the Feast
of Fools may be illustrated from an order for the reformation of the
Notre-Dame ceremony issued in 1199. This order was made by Eudes de
Sully, bishop of Paris, together with the dean and other chapter
officers<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>. It recites a mandate sent to them by cardinal Peter
of Capua, then legate in France. The legate had been informed of the
improprieties and disorders, even to shedding of blood, which had given
to the feast of the Circumcision in the cathedral the appropriate name
of the <i>festum fatuorum</i>. It was not a time for mirth, for the
fourth crusade had failed, and Pope Innocent III was preaching the
fifth. Nor could such <i>spurcitia</i> be allowed in the sanctuary
of God. The bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span> and his fellows must at once take order for the
pruning of the feast. In obedience to the legate they decree as
follows. The bells for first Vespers on the eve of the Circumcision
are to be rung in the usual way. There are to be no <i>chansons</i>,
no masks, and no hearse lights, except on the iron wheels or on the
<i>penna</i> at the will of the functionary who is to surrender the
cope<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>. The lord of the feast is not to be led in procession or with
singing to the cathedral or back to his house. He is to put on his cope
in the choir, and with the precentor’s <i>baculus</i> in his hand to
start the singing of the prose <i>Laetemur gaudiis</i><a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>. Vespers,
Compline, Matins and Mass are to be sung in the usual festal manner.
Certain small functions are reserved for the sub-deacons, and the
Epistle at Mass is to be ‘farced<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>.’ At second Vespers <i>Laetemur
gaudiis</i> is to be again sung, and also <i>Laetabundus</i><a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>.
Then comes an interesting direction. <i>Deposuit</i> is to be sung
where it occurs five times at most, and ‘if the <i>baculus</i> has
been taken,’ Vespers are to be closed by the ordinary officiant after
a <i>Te Deum</i>. Throughout the feast canons and clerks are to remain
properly in their stalls<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>. The abuses which it was intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> to
eliminate from the feast are implied rather than stated; but the
general character of the ceremony is clear. It consisted in the
predominance throughout the services, for this one day in the year, of
the despised sub-deacons. Probably they had been accustomed to take the
canons’ stalls. This Eudes de Sully forbids, but even, in the feast as
he left it the importance of the <i>dominus festi</i>, the sub-deacons’
representative, is marked by the transfer to him of the <i>baculus</i>,
and with it the precentor’s control. <i>Deposuit potentes de sede:
et exaltavit humiles</i> occurs in the <i>Magnificat</i>, which is
sung at Vespers; and the symbolical phrase, during which probably the
<i>baculus</i> was handed over from the <i>dominus</i> of one year
to the <i>dominus</i> of the next, became the keynote of the feast,
and was hailed with inordinate repetition by the delighted throng of
inferior clergy<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>Shortly after the Paris reformation a greater than Eudes de Sully and
a greater than Peter de Capua was stirred into action by the scandal
of the Feast of Fools and the cognate <i>tripudia</i>. In 1207, Pope
Innocent III issued a decretal to the archbishop and bishops of the
province of Gnesen in Poland, in which he called attention to the
introduction, especially during the Christmas feasts held by deacons,
priests and sub-deacons, of <i>larvae</i> or masks and <i>theatrales
ludi</i> into churches, and directed the discontinuance of the
practice<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>. This decretal was included as part of the permanent
canon law in the <i>Decretales</i> of Gregory IX in 1234<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>. But some
years before this it found support, so far as France was concerned, in
a national council held at Paris by the legate Robert de Courcon in
1212, at which both regular and secular clergy were directed to abstain
from the <i>festa follorum, ubi baculus accipitur</i><a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>.</p>

<p>It was now time for other cathedral chapters besides that of Paris
to set their houses in order, and good fortune has preserved to us
a singular monument of the attempts which they made to do so. The
so-called <i>Missel des Fous</i> of Sens may be seen in the municipal
library of that city<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>. It is enshrined in a Byzantine ivory diptych
of much older date<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span> than itself<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a>. It is not a missal at all. It is
headed <i>Officium Circumcisionis in usum urbis Senonensis</i>, and
is a choir-book containing the words and music of the <i>Propria</i>
or special chants used in the Hours and Mass at the feast<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>. Local
tradition at Sens, as far back as the early sixteenth century, ascribed
the compilation of this office to that very Petrus de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span> Corbolio who was
associated with Eudes de Sully in the Paris reformation<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>. Pierre de
Corbeil, whom scholastics called <i>doctor opinatissimus</i> and his
epitaph <i>flos et honor cleri</i>, had a varied ecclesiastical career.
As canon of Notre-Dame and reader in the Paris School of Theology he
counted amongst his pupils one no less distinguished than the future
Pope Innocent III himself. He became archdeacon of Evreux, coadjutor of
Lincoln (a fact of some interest in connexion with the scanty traces
of the Feast of Fools in England), bishop of Cambrai, and finally
archbishop of Sens, where he died in 1222. There is really no reason
to doubt his connexion with the <i>Officium</i>. The handwriting of
the manuscript and the character of the music are consistent with a
date early in the thirteenth century<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>. Elaborate and interpolated
offices were then still in vogue, and the good bishop enjoyed some
reputation for literature as well as for learning. He composed an
office for the Assumption, and is even suspected of contributions in
his youth to goliardic song<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>. It is unlikely that he actually
wrote much of the text of the <i>Officium Circumcisionis</i>, very
little of which is peculiar to Sens. But he may well have compiled or
revised it for his own cathedral, with the intention of pruning the
abuses of the feast; and, in so doing, he evidently admitted proses
and <i>farsurae</i> with a far more liberal hand than did Eudes de
Sully. The whole office, which is quite serious and not in the least
burlesque, well repays study. I can only dwell on those parts of it
which throw light on the general character of the celebration for which
it was intended.</p>

<p>The first Vespers on the eve of the Circumcision are preceded by four
lines sung <i>in ianuis ecclesiae</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>These lines are interesting, because they show that the

festa</i>, the ‘Feast of the Ass.’ They are followed by what is
popularly known as the ‘Prose of the Ass,’ but is headed in the
manuscript <i>Conductas ad tabulam</i>. A <i>conductus</i> is a chant
sung while the officiant is conducted from one station to another in
the church<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>, and the <i>tabula</i> is the <i>rota</i> of names
and duties <i>pro cantu et lectura</i>, with the reading of which the
Vespers began<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>. The text of the Prose of the Ass, as used at Sens
and elsewhere, is given in an appendix<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>. Next come a trope and a
farsed Alleluia, a long interpolation dividing ‘Alle-’ and ‘-luia,’ and
then another passage which has given a wrong impression of the nature
of the office:</p>

<p>The phrase <i>in falso</i> does not really mean ‘out of tune.’
It means, ‘with the harmonized accompaniment known as <i>en faux

The Vespers, with many further interpolations, then continue, and
after them follow Compline, Matins, Lauds<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a>, Prime, Tierce, the
Mass, Sext, and second Vespers. These end with three further pieces of
particular interest from our point of view. The first is a <i>Conductus
ad Bacularium</i>, the name <i>Bacularius</i> being doubtless that
given at Sens to the <i>dominus festi</i><a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>. This opens in a marked

<p>The manuscript ends, so far as the Feast of the Circumcision is
concerned, with some <i>Versus ad Prandium</i>, to be sung in the
refectory, taken from a hymn of Prudentius<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>.</p>

<p>The Sens <i>Missel des Fous</i> has been described again and again.
Less well known, however, is the very similar <i>Officium</i> of
Beauvais, and for the simple reason that although recent writers on
the Feast of Fools have been aware of its existence, they have not
been aware of its <i>habitat</i>. I have been fortunate enough to find
it in the British Museum, and only regret that I am not sufficiently
acquainted with textual and musical palaeography to print it <i>in
extenso</i> as an appendix to this chapter<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>. The date of the
manuscript is probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span> 1227-34<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>. Like that of Sens it contains
the <i>Propria</i> for the Feast of the Circumcision from Vespers
to Vespers. Unluckily, there is a lacuna of several pages in the
middle<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>. The office resembles that of Sens in general character,
but is much longer. There are two lines of opening rubric, of which
all that remains legible is&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>medio stantes incipit cantor</i>.
Then comes the quatrain <i>Lux hodie</i> similarly used at Sens, but
with the notable variant of <i>praesentia festa</i> for <i>asinaria
festa</i>. Then, under the rubric, also barely legible, <i>Conductus,
quando asinus adducitur</i><a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>, comes the ‘Prose of the Ass.’ At the
end of Lauds is the following rubric: <i>Postea omnes eant ante ianuas
ecclesiae clausas. Et quatuor stent foris tenentes singli urnas vino
plenas cum cyfis vitreis. Quorum unus canonicus incipiat</i> Kalendas
Ianuarias. <i>Tunc aperiantur ianuae.</i> Here comes the lacuna in the
manuscript, which begins again in the Mass. Shortly before the prayer
for the pope is a rubric <i>Quod dicitur, ubi apponatur baculus</i>,
which appears to be a direction for a ceremony not fully described in
the <i>Officium</i>. The ‘Prose of the Ass’ occurs a second time as
the <i>Conductus Subdiaconi ad Epistolam</i>, and on this occasion
the musical accompaniment is harmonized in three parts<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>. I can
find nothing about a <i>Bacularius</i> at second Vespers, but the
office ends with a series of <i>conductus</i> and hymns, some of which
are also harmonized in parts. The <i>Officium</i> is followed in the
manuscript by a Latin cloister play of <i>Daniel</i><a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>.</p>

<p>An earlier manuscript than that just described was formerly preserved
in the Beauvais cathedral library. It dated from 1160-80<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>. It
was known to Pierre Louvet, the seventeenth-century historian of
Beauvais<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>, and apparently to Dom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
    Grenier, who died in 1789<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>.
According to Grenier’s account it must have closely resembled that in
the British Museum.</p>

<p>‘Aux premières vêpres, le chantre commençait par entonner au milieu
de la nef: <i>Lux hodie, lux laetitiae</i>, etc.... À laudes rien de
particulier que le <i>Benedictus</i> et son répons farcis. Les laudes
finies on sortait de l’église pour aller trouver l’âne qui attendait
à la grande porte. Elle était fermée. Là, chacun des chanoines s’y
trouvant la bouteille et le verre à la main, le chantre entonnait la
prose: <i>Kalendas ianuarias solemne Christe facias</i>. Voici ce que
porte l’ancien cérémonial: <i>dominus cantor et canonici ante ianuas
ecclesiae clausas stent foris tenentes singuli urnas vini plenas cum
cyfis vitreis, quorum unus cantor incipiat: Kalendas ianuarias</i>,
etc. Les battants de la porte ouverts, on introduisait l’âne dans
l’église, en chantant la prose: <i>Orientis partibus</i>. Ici est
une lacune dans le manuscrit jusque vers le milieu du <i>Gloria in
excelsis</i>.... On chantait la litanie: <i>Christus vincit</i>,
<i>Christus regnat</i>, dans laquelle on priait pour le pape Alexandre
III, pour Henri de France, évêque de Beauvais, pour le roi Louis VII
et pour Alixe ou Adèle de Champagne qui était devenue reine en 1160;
par quoi on peut juger de l’antiquité de ce cérémonial. L’Évangile
était précédé d’une prose et suivi d’une autre. Il est marqué dans le
cérémonial de cinq cents ans que les encensements du jour de cette fête
se feront avec le boudin et la saucisse: <i>hac die incensabitur cum
boudino et saucita</i>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Dom Grenier gives as the authority for his last sentence, not the
<i>Officium</i>, but the <i>Glossary</i> of Ducange, or rather the
additions thereto made by certain Benedictine editors in 1733-6. They
quote the pudding and sausage rubric together with that as to the
drinking-bout, which occurs in both the <i>Officia</i>, as from a
Beauvais manuscript. This they describe as a <i>codex ann. circiter</i>
500<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>. It seems probable that this was not an <i>Officium</i>
at all, but something of the nature of a Processional, and that it
was identical with the <i>codex 500 annorum</i> from which the same
Benedictines derived their amazing account of a Beauvais ceremony
which took place not on January 1 but on January 14<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>. A pretty
girl, with a child in her arms, was set upon an ass, to represent
the Flight into Egypt. There was a procession from the cathedral to
the church of St. Stephen. The ass and its riders were stationed
on the gospel side of the altar. A solemn mass was sung, in which
<i>Introit</i>, <i>Kyrie</i>, <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Credo</i> ended with
a bray. To crown all, the rubrics direct that the celebrant, instead
of saying <i>Ite</i>, <i>missa est</i>, shall bray three times (<i>ter
hinhannabit</i>) and that the people shall respond in similar fashion.
At this ceremony also the ‘Prose of the Ass’ was used, and the version
preserved in the <i>Glossary</i> is longer and more ludicrous than that
of either the Sens or the Beauvais <i>Officium</i>.</p>

<p>On a review of all the facts it would seem that the Beauvais documents
represent a stage of the feast unaffected by any such reform as that
carried out by Pierre de Corbeil at Sens. And the nature of that
reform is fairly clear. Pierre de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span> Corbeil provided a text of the
<i>Officium</i> based either on that of Beauvais or on an earlier
version already existing at Sens. He probably added very little of his
own, for the Sens manuscript only contains a few short passages not
to be found in that of Beauvais. And as the twelfth-century Beauvais
manuscript seems to have closely resembled the thirteenth-century one
still extant, Beauvais cannot well have borrowed from him. At the same
time he doubtless suppressed whatever burlesque ceremonies, similar
to the Beauvais drinking-bout in the porch and censing with pudding
and sausage, may have been in use at Sens. One of these was possibly
the actual introduction of an ass into the church. But it must be
remembered that the most extravagant of such ceremonies would not be
likely at either place to get into the formal service-books<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>. As
the Sens <i>Officium</i> only includes the actual service of January 1
itself, it is impossible to compare the way in which the semi-dramatic
extension of the feast was treated in the two neighbouring cathedrals.
But Sens probably had this extension, for as late as 1634 there was an
annual procession, in which the leading figures were the Virgin Mary
mounted on an ass and a <i>cortège</i> of the twelve Apostles. This did
not, however, at that time take part in the Mass<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>.</p>

<p>The full records of the Feast of Fools at Sens do not begin until the
best part of a century after the probable date of its <i>Officium</i>.
But one isolated notice breaks the interval, and shows that the efforts
of Pierre de Corbeil were not for long successful in purging the revel
of its abuses. This is a letter written to the chapter in 1245 by Odo,
cardinal of Tusculum, who was then papal legate in France. He calls
attention to the <i>antiqua ludibria</i> of the feasts of Christmas
week and of the Circumcision, and requires these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span> to be celebrated,
not <i>iuxta pristinum modum</i>, but with the proper ecclesiastical
ceremonies. He specifically reprobates the use of unclerical dress and
the wearing of wreaths of flowers<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>.</p>

<p>A little later in date than either the Sens or the Beauvais
<i>Officium</i> is a <i>Ritual</i> of St. Omer, which throws some light
on the Feast of Fools as it was celebrated in the northern town on the
day of the Circumcision about 1264. It was the feast of the vicars and
the choir. A ‘bishop’ and a ‘dean’ of Fools took part in the services.
The latter was censed in burlesque fashion, and the whole office was
recited at the pitch of the voice, and even with howls. There cannot
have been much of a reformation here<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>.</p>

<p>A few other scattered notices of thirteenth-century Feasts of Fools
may be gathered together. The <i>Roman de Renard</i> is witness to
the existence of such a feast, with <i>jeux</i> and tippling, at
Bayeux, about 1200<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>. At Autun, the chapter forbade the <i>baculus
anni novi</i> in 1230<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a>. Feasts of Fools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span> on Innocents’ and
New Year’s days are forbidden by the statutes of Nevers cathedral
in 1246<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>. At Romans, in Dauphiné, an agreement was come to in
1274 between the chapter, the archbishop of Vienne and the municipal
authorities, that the choice of an abbot by the cathedral clerks known
as <i>esclaffardi</i> should cease, on account of the disturbances
and scandals to which it had given rise<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>. The earliest mention
of the feast at Laon is about 1280<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>; while it is provided for as
the sub-deacons’ feast by an Amiens <i>Ordinarium</i> of 1291<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>.
Nor are the ecclesiastical writers oblivious of it. William of
Auxerre opens an era of learned speculation in his <i>De Officiis
Ecclesiasticis</i>, by explaining it as a Christian substitute for the
<i>Parentalia</i> of the pagans<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>. Towards the end of the century,
Durandus, bishop of Mende, who drew upon both William of Auxerre and
Belethus for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span> his <i>Rationale Divinorum Officiorum</i>, gave an
account of it which agrees closely with that of Belethus<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>. Neither
William of Auxerre nor Durandus shows himself hostile to the Feast of
Fools. Its abuses are, however, condemned in more than one contemporary
collection of sermons<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>.</p>

<p>With the fourteenth century the records of the Feast of Fools become
more frequent. In particular, the account-books of the chapter of
Sens throw some light on the organization of the feast in that
cathedral<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>. The <i>Compotus Camerarii</i> has, from 1345
onwards, a yearly entry <i>pro vino praesentato vicariis ecclesiae
die Circumcisionis Domini</i>. Sometimes the formula is varied to
<i>die festi fatuorum</i>. In course of time the whole expenses of
the feast come to be a charge on the chapter, and in particular, it
would appear, upon the sub-deacon canons<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>. In 1376 is mentioned,
for the first time, the <i>dominus festi</i>, to whom under the
title of <i>precentor et provisor festi stultorum</i> a payment is
made. The <i>Compotus Nemorum</i> shows that by 1374 a prebend in
the chapter woods had been appropriated to the vicars <i>pro festo
fatuorum</i>. Similar entries occur to the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> fourteenth
century and during the first quarter of the fifteenth<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>. Then
came the war to disturb everything, and from 1420 the account-books
rarely show any traces of the feast. Nor were civil commotions
alone against it. As in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, so
in the fourteenth and fifteenth the abuses which clung about the
Feasts of Fools rendered them everywhere a mark for the eloquence
of ecclesiastical reformers. About 1400 the famous theologian and
rector of Paris University, Jean-Charlier de Gerson, put himself
at the head of a crusade against the <i>ritus ille impiissimus et
insanus qui regnat per totam Franciam</i>, and denounced it roundly
in sermons and <i>conclusiones</i>. The indecencies of the feast, he
declares, would shame a kitchen or a tavern. The chapters will do
nothing to stop them, and if the bishops protest, they are flouted and
defied. The scandal can only be ended by the interposition of royal
authority<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span> to Gerson, Charles the Sixth did on one
occasion issue letters against the feast; and the view of the reformers
found support in the diocesan council of Langres in 1404<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>, and
the provincial council of Tours, held at Nantes in 1431<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>. It
was a more serious matter when, some years after Gerson’s death, the
great council of Basle included a prohibition of the feast in its
reformatory decrees of 1435<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>. By the Pragmatic Sanction issued
by Charles VII at the national council of Bourges in 1438, these
decrees became ecclesiastical law in France<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>, and it was competent
for the <i>Parlements</i> to put them into execution<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>. But the
chapters were obstinate; the feasts were popular, not only with the
inferior clergy themselves, but with the <i>spectacle</i>-loving
<i>bourgeois</i> of the cathedral towns; and it was only gradually that
they died out during the course of the next century and a half. The
failure of the Pragmatic Sanction to secure immediate obedience in this
matter roused the University of Paris, still possessed with the spirit
of Gerson, to fresh action. On March 12, 1445, the Faculty of Theology,
acting through its dean, Eustace de Mesnil, addressed to the bishops
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span> chapters of France a letter which, from the minuteness of its
indictment, is perhaps the most curious of the many curious documents
concerning the feast<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>. It consists of a preamble and no less than
fourteen <i>conclusiones</i>, some of which are further complicated by
<i>qualificationes</i>. The preamble sets forth the facts concerning
the <i>festum fatuorum</i>. It has its clear origin, say the
theologians, in the rites of paganism, amongst which this Janus-worship
of the Kalends has alone been allowed to survive. They then describe
the customs of the feast in a passage which I must translate:</p>

<p>‘Priests and clerks may be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at
the hours of office. They dance in the choir dressed as women, panders
or minstrels. They sing wanton songs. They eat black puddings at the
horn of the altar while the celebrant is saying mass. They play at dice
there. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They
run and leap through the church, without a blush at their own shame.
Finally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby traps and
carts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in
infamous performances, with indecent gestures and verses scurrilous and
unchaste<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>.’</p>

<p>There follows a refutation of the argument that such <i>ludi</i>
are but the relaxation of the bent bow in a fashion sanctioned by
antiquity. On the contrary, they are due to original sin, and the
snares of devils. The bishops are besought to follow the example of
St. Paul and St. Augustine, of bishops Martin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span> Hilarius, Chrysostom,
Nicholas and Germanus of Auxerre, all of whom made war on sacrilegious
practices, not to speak of the canons of popes and general councils,
and to stamp out the <i>ludibria</i>. It rests with them, for the
clergy will not be so besotted as to face the Inquisition and the
secular arm<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>conclusiones</i> thus introduced yield a few further data as
to the ceremonies of the feast. It seems to be indifferently called
<i>festum stultorum</i> and <i>festum fatuorum</i>. It takes place
in cathedrals and collegiate churches, on Innocents’ day, on St.
Stephen’s, on the Circumcision, or on other dates. ‘Bishops’ or
‘archbishops’ of Fools are chosen, who wear mitres and pastoral staffs,
and have crosses borne before them, as if they were on visitation. They
take the Office, and give Benedictions to the readers of the lessons
at Matins, and to the congregations. In exempt churches, subject only
to the Holy See, a ‘pope’ of Fools is naturally chosen instead of a
‘bishop’ or an ‘archbishop.’ The clergy wear the garments of the laity
or of fools, and the laity put on priestly or monastic robes. <i>Ludi
theatrales</i> and <i>personagiorum ludi</i> are performed.</p>

<p>The manifesto of the Theological Faculty helped in at least one town
to bring matters to a crisis. At Troyes the Feast of Fools appears
to have been celebrated on the Circumcision in the three great
collegiate churches of St. Peter, St. Stephen, and St. Urban, and
on Epiphany in the abbey of St. Loup. The earliest records are from
St. Peter’s. In 1372 the chapter forbade the vicars to celebrate the
feast without leave. In 1380 and 1381 there are significant entries
of payments for damage done: in the former year Marie-la-Folle broke
a <i>candelabrum</i>; in the latter a cross had to be repaired and
gilded. In 1436, the year after the council of Basle, leave was
given to hold the feast without irreverence. In 1439, the year after
the Pragmatic Sanction, it was forbidden. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span> 1443, it was again
permitted. But it must be outside the church. The ‘archbishop’ might
wear a rochet, but the supper must take place in the house of one of
the canons, and not at a tavern. The experiment was not altogether a
success, for a canon had to be fined twenty sous <i>pour les grandes
sottises et les gestes extravagants qu’il s’était permis à la fête
des fols</i><a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>. Towards the end of 1444, when it was proposed to
renew the feast, the bishop of Troyes, Jean Leguisé, intervened. The
clergy of St. Peter’s were apparently willing to submit, but those of
St. Stephen’s stood out. They told the bishop that they were exempt
from his jurisdiction, and subject only to his metropolitan, the
archbishop of Sens; and they held an elaborate revel with even more
than the usual insolence and riot. On the Sunday before Christmas
they publicly consecrated their ‘archbishop’ in the most public place
of the town with a <i>jeu de personnages</i> called <i>le jeu du
sacre de leur arcevesque</i>, which was a burlesque of the <i>saint
mistère de consécration pontificale</i>. The feast itself took place
in St. Stephen’s Church. The vicar who was chosen ‘archbishop’
performed the service on the eve and day of the Circumcision <i>in
pontificalibus</i>, gave the Benediction to the people, and went in
procession through the town. Finally, on Sunday, January 3, the clergy
of all three churches joined in another <i>jeu de personnages</i>,
in which, under the names of <i>Hypocrisie</i>, <i>Faintise</i> and
<i>Faux-semblant</i>, the bishop and two canons who had been most
active in opposing the feast, were held up to ridicule. Jean Leguisé
was not a man to be defied with impunity. On January 23 he wrote a
letter to the archbishop of Sens, Louis de Melun, calling his attention
to the fact that the rebellious clerks had claimed his authority for
their action. He also lodged a complaint with the king himself, and
probably incited the Faculty of Theology at Paris to back him up with
the protest already described. The upshot of it all was a sharp letter
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> Charles VII to the <i>bailly</i> and <i>prévost</i> of Troyes,
setting forth what had taken place, and requiring them to see that no
repetition of the scandalous <i>jeux</i> was allowed<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>. Shortly
afterwards the chapter of St. Peter’s sent for their <i>Ordinarium</i>,
and solemnly erased all that was derogatory to religion and the good
name of the clergy in the directions for the feast. What the chapter
of St. Stephen’s did, we do not know. The canons mainly to blame had
already apologized to the bishop. Probably it was thought best to say
nothing, and let it blow over. At any rate, it is interesting to note
that in 1595, a century and a half later, St. Stephen’s was still
electing its <i>archevesque des saulx</i>, and that <i>droits</i> were
paid on account of the vicars’ feast until all <i>droits</i> tumbled in
1789<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>.</p>

<p>The proceedings at Troyes seem to have reacted upon the feast at Sens.
In December, 1444, the chapter had issued an elaborate order for the
regulation of the ceremony, in which they somewhat pointedly avoided
any reference to the council of Basle or the Pragmatic Sanction,
and cited only the legatine statute of Odo of Tusculum in 1245. The
order requires that divine service shall be devoutly and decently
performed, <i>prout iacet in libro ipsius servitii</i>. By this is
doubtless meant the <i>Officium</i> already described. There must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
be no mockery or impropriety, no unclerical costume, no dissonant
singing. Then comes what, considering that this is a reform, appears
a sufficiently remarkable direction. Not more than three buckets of
water at most must be poured over the <i>precentor stultorum</i> at
Vespers. The custom of ducking on St. John’s eve, apparently the
occasion when the precentor was elected, is also pruned, and a final
clause provides that if nobody’s rights are infringed the <i>stulti</i>
may do what they like outside the church<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a>. Under these straitened
conditions the feast was probably held in 1445. There was, however,
the archbishop as well as the chapter to be reckoned with. It was
difficult for Louis de Melun, after the direct appeal made to him by
his suffragan at Troyes, to avoid taking some action, and in certain
statutes promulgated in November, 1445, he required the suppression
of the whole <i>consuetudo</i> and ordered the directions for it to
be erased from the chant-books<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>. There is now no mention of the
feast until 1486, from which date an occasional payment for <i>la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
feste du premier jour de l’an</i> begins to appear again in the chapter
account-books<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>. In 1511, the <i>servitium divinum</i> after the
old custom is back in the church. But the chapter draws a distinction
between the <i>servitium</i> and the <i>festum stultorum</i>, which
is forbidden. The performance of <i>jeux de personnages</i> and the
public shaving of the precentor’s beard on a stage are especially
reprobated<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>. The <i>servitium</i> was again allowed in 1514, 1516,
1517, and in 1520 with a provision that the <i>lucerna precentoris
fatuorum</i> must not be brought into the church<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>. In 1522, both
<i>servitium</i> and <i>festum</i> were forbidden on account of the
war with Spain; the shaving of the precentor and the ceremony of his
election on the feast of St. John the Evangelist again coming in for
express prohibition<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>. In 1523 the <i>servitium</i> was allowed
upon a protest by the vicars, but only with the strict exclusion of the
popular elements<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>. In 1524 even the <i>servitium</i> was withheld,
and though sanctioned again in 1535, 1539 and 1543, it was finally
suppressed in 1547<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>. Some feast, however, would still seem to have
been held, probably outside the church, until 1614<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>, and even as
late as 1634 there was a trace of it in the annual procession of the
Virgin Mary and the Apostles, already referred to.</p>

<p>This later history of the feast at Sens is fairly typical, as the
following chapter will show, of what took place all over France.
The chapters by no means showed themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> universally willing to
submit to the decree promulgated in the Pragmatic Sanction. In many of
them the struggle between the conservative and the reforming parties
was spread over a number of years. Councils, national, provincial
and diocesan, continued to find it necessary to condemn the feast,
mentioning it either by name or in a common category with other
<i>ludi</i>, <i>spectacula</i>, <i>choreae</i>, <i>tripudia</i> and
<i>larvationes</i><a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a>. In one or two instances the authority of the
<i>Parlements</i> was invoked. But in the majority of cases the feast
either gradually disappeared, or else passed, first from the churches
into the streets, and then from the clerks to the <i>bourgeois</i>,
often to receive a new life under quite altered circumstances at the
hands of some witty and popular <i>compagnie des fous</i><a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>.</p>

<span class="small">THE FEAST OF FOOLS (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The history of the Feast of Fools has been so imperfectly written,
that it is perhaps worth while to bring together the records of its
occurrence, elsewhere than in Troyes and Sens, from the fourteenth
century onwards. They could probably be somewhat increased by an
exhaustive research amongst French local histories, archives, and
the transactions of learned societies. Of the feast in Notre-Dame at
Paris nothing is heard after the reformation carried out in 1198 by
Eudes de Sully<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>. The <i>bourgeois</i> of Tournai were, indeed,
able to quote a Paris precedent for the feast of their own city in
1499; but this may have been merely the feast of some minor collegiate
body, such as that founded in 1303 by cardinal Le Moine<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>; or of
the scholars of the University, or of the <i>compagnie joyeuse</i>
of the <i>Enfants-sans-Souci</i>. At Beauvais, too, there are only
the faintest traces of the feast outside the actual twelfth-and
thirteenth-century service-books<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>. But there are several other
towns in the provinces immediately north and east of the capital, Île
de France, Picardy, Champagne, where it is recorded. The provision
made for it in the Amiens <i>Ordinarium</i> of 1291 has been already
quoted. Shortly after this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span> bishop William de Macon, who died in
1303, left his own <i>pontificalia</i> for the use of the ‘bishop of
Fools<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>.’ When, however, the feast reappears in the fifteenth
century the <i>dominus festi</i> is no longer a ‘bishop,’ but a
‘pope.’ In 1438 there was an endowment consisting of a share in the
profits of some lead left by one John le Caron, who had himself been
‘pope<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>.’ In 1520 the feast was held, but no bells were to be
jangled<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>. It was repeated in 1538. Later in the year the customary
election of the ‘pope’ on the anniversary of Easter was forbidden,
but the canons afterwards repented of their severity<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>. In 1540
the chapter paid a subsidy towards the amusements of the ‘pope’ and
his ‘cardinals’ on the Sunday called <i>brioris</i><a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>. In 1548
the feast was suppressed<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>. At Noyon the vicars chose a ‘king of
Fools’ on Epiphany eve. The custom is mentioned in 1366 as ‘<i>le gieu
des roys</i>.’ By 1419 it was forbidden, and canon John de Gribauval
was punished for an attempt to renew it by taking the sceptre off
the high altar at Compline on Epiphany. In 1497, 1499, and 1505 it
was permitted again, with certain restrictions. The cavalcade must
be over before Nones; there must be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span> licentious or scurrilous
<i>chansons</i>, no dance before the great doors; the ‘king’ must wear
ecclesiastical dress in the choir. In 1520, however, he was allowed
to wear his crown <i>more antiquo</i>. The feast finally perished
in 1721, owing to <i>la cherté des vivres</i><a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a>. At Soissons,
the feast was held on January 1, with masquing<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>. At Senlis, the
<i>dominus festi</i> was a ‘pope.’ In 1403 there was much division of
opinion amongst the chapter as to the continuance of the feast, and
it was finally decided that it must take place outside the church. In
1523 it came to an end. The vicars of the chapter of Saint-Rieul had
in 1501 their separate feast on January 1, with a ‘prelate of Fools’
and <i>jeux</i> in the churchyard<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>. From Laon fuller records are
available<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>. A ‘patriarch of Fools’ was chosen with his ‘consorts’
on Epiphany eve after Prime, by the vicars, chaplains and choir-clerks.
There was a cavalcade through the city and a procession called the
<i>Rabardiaux</i>, of which the nature is not stated<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>. The chapter
bore the expenses of the banquet and the masks. The first notice is
about 1280. In 1307 one Pierre Caput was ‘patriarch.’ In 1454 the
bishop upheld the feast against the dean, but it was decided that
it should take place outside the church. A similar regulation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
made in 1455, 1456, 1459. In 1462 the <i>servitium</i> was allowed,
and the <i>jeu</i> was to be submitted to censorship. In 1464 and
1465 mysteries were acted before the <i>Rabardiaux</i>. In 1486 the
<i>jeu</i> was given before the church of St.-Martin-au-Parvis. In 1490
the <i>jeux</i> and cavalcade were forbidden, and the banquet only
allowed. In 1500 a chaplain, Jean Hubreland, was fined for not taking
part in the ceremony. In 1518 the worse fate of imprisonment befell
Albert Gosselin, another chaplain, who flung fire from above the porch
upon the ‘patriarch’ and his ‘consorts.’ By 1521 the <i>servitium</i>
seems to have been conducted by the <i>curés</i> of the Laon churches,
and the vicars and chaplains merely assisted. The expense now fell on
the <i>curés</i>, and the chapter subsidy was cut down. In 1522 and
1525 the perquisites of the ‘patriarch’ were still further reduced by
the refusal of a donation from the chapter as well as of the fines
formerly imposed on absentees. In 1527 a protest of Laurent Brayart,
‘patriarch,’ demanding either leave to celebrate the feast <i>more
antiquo</i> or a dispensation from assisting at the election of his
successor, was referred to the ex-‘patriarch.’ In this same year
canons, vicars, chaplains and <i>habitués</i> of the cathedral were
forbidden to appear at the farces of the <i>fête des ânes</i><a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a>.
In 1531 the ‘patriarch’ Théobald Bucquet, recovered the right to play
comedies and <i>jeux</i> and to take the absentee fines; but in 1541
Absalon Bourgeois was refused leave <i>pour faire semblant de dire la
messe à liesse</i>. The feast was cut down to the bare election of
the ‘patriarch’ in 1560, and seems to have passed into the hands of
a <i>confrérie</i>; all that was retained in the cathedral being the
<i>Primes folles</i> on Epiphany eve, in which the laity occupied the
high stalls, and all present wore crowns of green leaves.</p>

<p>At Rheims, a Feast of Fools in 1490 was the occasion for a satirical
attack by the vicars and choir-boys on the fashion of the hoods worn
by the <i>bourgeoises</i>. This led to reprisals in the form of some
anti-ecclesiastical farces played on the following <i>dimanche des
Brandons</i> by the law clerks of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> Rheims <i>Basoche</i><a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>.
At Châlons-sur-Marne a detailed and curious account is preserved of
the way in which the Feast of Fools was celebrated in 1570<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a>. It
took place on St. Stephen’s day. The chapter provided a banquet on a
theatre in front of the great porch. To this the ‘bishop of Fools’
was conducted in procession from the <i>maîtrise des fous</i>, with
bells and music upon a gaily trapped ass. He was then vested in cope,
mitre, pectoral cross, gloves and crozier, and enjoyed a banquet
with the canons who formed his ‘household.’ Meanwhile some of the
inferior clergy entered the cathedral, sang gibberish, grimaced and
made contortions. After the banquet, Vespers were precipitately sung,
followed by a <i>motet</i><a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>. Then came a musical cavalcade round
the cathedral and through the streets. A game of <i>la paume</i> took
place in the market; then dancing and further cavalcades. Finally
a band gathered before the cathedral, howled and clanged kettles
and saucepans, while the bells were rung and the clergy appeared in
grotesque costumes.</p>

<p>Flanders also had its Feasts of Fools. That of St. Omer, which existed
in the twelfth century, lasted to the sixteenth<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>. An attempt was
made to stop it in 1407, when the chapter forbade any one to take
the name of ‘bishop’ or ‘abbot’ of Fools. But Seraphin Cotinet was
‘bishop’ of Fools in 1431, and led the <i>gaude</i> on St. Nicholas’
eve<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>. The ‘bishop’ is again mentioned in 1490, but in 1515 the
feast was suppressed by Francis de Melun, bishop of Arras and provost
of St. Omer<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>. Some payments made by the chapter of Béthune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
in 1445 and 1474 leave it doubtful how far the feast was really
established in that cathedral<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>. At Lille the feast was forbidden
by the chapter statutes of 1323 and 1328<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>. But at the end of the
fourteenth century it was in full swing, lasting under its ‘bishop’
or ‘prelate’ from the vigil to the octave of Epiphany. Amongst the
payments made by the chapter on account of it is one to replace a
tin can (<i>kanne stannee</i>) lost at the banquet. The ‘bishop’ was
chosen, as elsewhere, by the inferior clergy of the cathedral; but
he also stood in some relation to the municipality of Lille, and
superintended the miracle plays performed at the procession of the Holy
Sacrament and upon other occasions. In 1393 he received a payment from
the duke of Burgundy for the <i>fête</i> of the <i>Trois Rois</i>.
Municipal subsidies were paid to him in the fifteenth century; he
collected additional funds from private sources and offered prizes,
by proclamation <i>soubz nostre seel de fatuité</i>, for pageants and
<i>histoires de la Sainte Escripture</i>; was, in fact, a sort of
Master of the Revels for Lille. He was active in 1468, but in 1469
the town itself gave the prizes, in place <i>de l’evesque des folz,
qui à présent est rué jus</i>. The chapter accounts show that he was
reappointed in 1485 <i>hoc anno, de gratia speciali</i>. In 1492
and 1493 the chapter payments were not to him but <i>sociis domus
clericorum</i>, and from this year onwards he appears neither in the
chapter accounts nor in those of the municipality<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>. Nevertheless,
he did not yet cease to exist, for a statute was passed by the chapter
for his extinction, together with that of the <i>ludus, quem Deposuit
vocant</i>, in 1531<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>. Five years before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span> this the canons and
vicars were still wearing masks and playing comedies in public<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>.
The history of the feast at Tournai is only known to me through certain
legal proceedings which took place before the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris
in 1499. It appears that the young <i>bourgeois</i> of Tournai were
accustomed to require the vicars of Notre-Dame to choose an <i>évesque
des sotz</i> from amongst themselves on Innocents’ day. In 1489 they
took one Matthieu de Porta and insulted him in the church itself. The
chapter brought an action in the local court against the <i>prévost et
jurez</i> of the town; and in the meantime obtained provisional letters
inhibitory from Charles VIII, forbidding the vicars to hold the feast
or the <i>bourgeois</i> to enforce it. All went well for some years,
but in 1497 the <i>bourgeois</i> grumbled greatly, and in 1498, with
the connivance of the municipal authorities themselves, they broke
out. On the eve of the Holy Innocents, between nine and ten o’clock,
Jacques de l’Arcq, mayor of the <i>Edwardeurs</i>, and others got into
the house of Messire Pasquier le Pâme, a chaplain, and dragged him half
naked, through snow and frost, to a <i>cabaret</i>. Seven or eight
other vicars, one of whom was found saying his Hours in a churchyard,
were similarly treated, and as none of them would be made <i>évesque
des sotz</i> they were all kept prisoners. The chapter protested to
the <i>prévost et jurez</i>, but in vain. On the following day the
<i>bourgeois</i> chose one of the vicars <i>évesque</i>, baptized him
by torchlight with three buckets of water at a fountain, led him about
for three days in a surplice, and played scurrilous farces. They then
dismissed the vicar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span> and elected as <i>évesque</i> a clerk from the
diocese of Cambrai, who defied the chapter. They drove Jean Parisiz,
the <i>curé</i> of La Madeleine, who had displeased them, from his
church in the midst of Vespers, and on Epiphany day made him too a
prisoner. In the following March the chapter and Messire Jean Parisiz
brought a joint action before the High Court at Paris against the
delinquents and the municipal authorities, who had backed them up. The
case came on for hearing in November, when it was pleaded that the
custom of electing an <i>évesque des sotz</i> upon Innocents’ day was
an ancient one. The ceremony took place upon a scaffold near the church
door; there were <i>jeux</i> in the streets for seven or eight days,
and a final <i>convici</i> in which the canons and others of the town
were satirized. The chapter and some of the citizens sent bread and
wine. The same thing was done in many dioceses of Picardy, and even in
Paris. It was all <i>ad solacium populi</i>, and divine service was not
disturbed, for nobody entered the church. The vicar who had been chosen
<i>évesque</i> thought it a great and unexpected honour. There would
have been no trouble had not the <i>évesque</i> when distributing hoods
with ears at the end of the <i>jeux</i> unfortunately included certain
persons who would rather have been left out, and who consequently
stirred up the chapter to take action. The court adjourned the case,
and ultimately it appears to have been settled, for one of the
documents preserved is endorsed with a note of a <i>concordat</i>
between the chapter and the town, by which the feast was abolished in
1500<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the Feast of Fools in central France I can say but little. At
Chartres, the <i>Papi-Fol</i> and his cardinals committed many
insolences during the first four days of the year, and exacted
<i>droits</i> from passers-by. They were suppressed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span> 1479 and again
in 1504<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>. At Tours a <i>Ritual</i> of the fourteenth century
contains elaborate directions for the <i>festum novi anni, quod non
debet remanere, nisi corpora sint humi</i>. This is clearly a reformed
feast, of which the chief features are the dramatic procession of the
<i>Prophetae</i>, including doubtless Balaam on his ass, in church,
and a <i>miraculum</i> in the cloister<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>. The ‘Boy Bishop’ gives
the benediction at Tierce, and before Vespers there are <i>chori</i>
(carols, I suppose) also in the cloisters. At Vespers <i>Deposuit</i>
is sung three times, and the <i>baculus</i> may be taken. If so,
the <i>thesaurarius</i> is beaten with <i>baculi</i> by the clergy
at Compline, and the new <i>cantor</i> is led home with beating of
<i>baculi</i> on the walls<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>. At Bourges, the use of the ‘Prose of
the Ass’ in Notre-Dame de Sales seems to imply the existence of the
feast, but I know no details<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>. At Avallon the <i>dominus festi</i>
seems to have been, as at Laon, a ‘patriarch,’ and to have officiated
on Innocents’ day. A chapter statute regulated the proceedings in 1453,
and another abolished them in 1510<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>. At Auxerre, full accounts
of a long chapter wrangle are preserved in the register<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>. It
began in 1395 with an order requiring the decent performance of the
<i>servitium</i>, and imposing a fee upon newly admitted canons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
towards the feast. In 1396 the feast was not held, owing to the recent
defeat of Sigismund of Hungary and the count of Nevers by Bajazet and
his Ottomans at Nicopolis<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>. In 1398 the dean entered a protest
against a grant of wine made by the chapter to the thirsty revellers.
In 1400 a further order was passed to check various abuses, the
excessive ringing of bells, the licence of the <i>sermones fatui</i>,
the impounding of copes in pledge for contributions, the beating of
men and women through the streets, and all <i>derisiones</i> likely
to bring discredit on the church<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a>. In the following January,
the bishop of Auxerre, Michel de Crency, intervened, forbidding
the <i>fatui</i> to form a ‘chapter,’ or to appoint ‘proctors,’ or
<i>clamare la fête aux fous</i> after the singing of the Hours in
the church. This led to a storm. The bishop brought an action in the
secular court, and the chapter appealed to the ecclesiastical court of
the Sens province. In June, however, it was agreed as part of a general
<i>concordat</i> between the parties, that all these proceedings should
be <i>non avenu</i><a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>. It seems, however, to have been understood
that the chapter would reform the feast. On December 2, the abbot
of Pontigny preached a sermon before the chapter in favour of the
abolition of the feast, and on the following day the dean came down and
warned the canons that it was the intention of the University of Paris
to take action, even if necessary, by calling in the secular arm<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>.
It was better to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span> reform themselves than to be reformed. It was then
agreed to suppress the abuses of the feast, the sermons and the
wearing of unecclesiastical garb, and to hold nothing but a <i>festum
subdiaconorum</i> on the day of the Circumcision. Outside the church,
however, the clergy might dance and promenade (<i>chorizare&nbsp;...&nbsp;et ...
spatiare</i>) on the <i>place</i> of St. Stephen’s. These regulations
were disregarded, on the plea that they were intended to apply only to
the year in which they were made. In 1407 the chapter declared that
they were to be permanent, but strong opposition was offered to this
decision by three canons, Jean Piqueron, himself a sub-deacon, Jean
Bonat, and Jean Berthome, who maintained that the <i>concordat</i> with
the bishop was for reform, not for abolition. The matter was before
the chapter for the last time, so far as the extant documents go, in
1411. On January 2, the dean reported that in spite of the prohibition
certain <i>canonici tortrarii</i><a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a>, chaplains and choir-clerks
had held the feast. A committee of investigation was appointed, and
in December the prohibition was renewed. Jean Piqueron was once more
a protestant, and on this occasion obtained the support of five
colleagues<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a>. It may be added that in the sixteenth century an
<i>abbas stultorum</i> was still annually elected on July 18, beneath
a great elm at the porch of Auxerre cathedral. He was charged with the
maintenance of certain small points of choir discipline<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>.</p>

<p>In Franche Comté and Burgundy, the Feast of Fools is also found. At
Besançon it was celebrated by all the four great churches. In the
cathedrals of St. John and St. Stephen, ‘cardinals’ were chosen on
St. Stephen’s day by the deacons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span> and sub-deacons, on St. John’s
day by the priests, on the Holy Innocents’ day by the choir-clerks
and choir-boys. In the collegiate churches of St. Paul and St. Mary
Magdalen, ‘bishops’ or ‘abbots’ were similarly chosen. All these
<i>domini festorum</i> seem to have had the generic title of <i>rois
des fous</i>, and on the choir-feast four cavalcades went about the
streets and exchanged railleries (<i>se chantaient pouille</i>) when
they met. In 1387 the <i>Statutes</i> of cardinal Thomas of Naples
ordered that the feasts should be held jointly in each church in turn;
and in 1518 the cavalcades were suppressed, owing to a conflict upon
the bridge which had a fatal ending. Up to 1710, however, <i>reges</i>
were still elected in St. Mary Magdalen’s; not, indeed, those for
the three feasts of Christmas week, but a <i>rex capellanorum</i>
and a <i>rex canonicorum</i>, who officiated respectively on the
Circumcision and on Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>. At Autun the feast of the
<i>baculus</i> in the thirteenth century has already been recorded.
In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries some interesting notices are
available in the chapter registers<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>. In 1411 the feast required
reforming. The canons were ordered to attend in decent clothes as
on the Nativity; and the custom of leading an ass in procession and
singing a <i>cantilena</i> thereon was suppressed<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a>. In 1412 the
abolition of the feast was decreed<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>. But in 1484 it was sanctioned
again, and licence was given to punish those who failed to put in an
appearance at the Hours by burning at the well<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span> This custom,
however, was forbidden in 1498<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>. Nothing more is heard of the
<i>asinus</i>, but it is possible that he figured in the play of
<i>Herod</i> which was undoubtedly performed at the feast, and which
gave a name to the <i>dominus festi</i><a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a>. Under the general name
of <i>festa fatuorum</i> was included at Autun, besides the feast of
the Circumcision, also that of the ‘bishop’ and ‘dean’ of Innocents,
and a <i>missa fatuorum</i> was sung <i>ex ore infantium</i> from the
Innocents’ day to Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>. In 1499 Jean Rolin, abbot of St.
Martin’s and dean of Autun, led a renewed attack upon the feast. He had
armed himself with a letter from Louis XI, and induced the chapter, in
virtue of the Basle decree, to suppress both Herod and the ‘bishop’
of Innocents<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>. In 1514 and 1515 the play of <i>Herod</i> was
performed; but in 1518, when application was made to the chapter to
sanction the election of both a ‘Herod’ and the ‘bishop’ and ‘dean’
of Innocents, they applied to the king’s official for leave, and
failed to get it. Finally in 1535 the chapter recurred to the Basle
decree, and again forbade the feast, particularly specifying under the
name of <i>Gaigizons</i> the obnoxious ceremony of ‘ducking.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a>’
The feast held in the ducal, afterwards royal chapel of Dijon yields
documents which are unique, because they are in French verse. The first
is a <i>mandement</i> of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1454,
confirming, on the request of the <i>haut-Bâtonnier</i>, the privilege
of the fête, against those who would abolish it. He declares</p>

<p>There was a second feast in Dijon at the church of St. Stephen. In 1494
it was the custom here, as at Sens, to shave the ‘precentor’ of Fools
upon a stage before the church. In 1621 the vicars still paraded the
streets with music and lanterns in honour of their ‘precentor<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>.’
In 1552, however, the Feasts of Fools throughout Burgundy had been
prohibited by an <i>arrêt</i> of the <i>Parlement</i> of Dijon. This
was immediately provoked by the desire of the chapter of St. Vincent’s
at Châlons-sur-Saône to end the scandal of the feast under their
jurisdiction. It was, however, general in its terms, and probably put
an end to the <i>Chapelle</i> feast at Dijon, since to about this
period may be traced the origin of the famous <i>compagnie</i> of the
<i>Mère-Folle</i> in that city<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>.</p>

<p>In Dauphiné there was a <i>rex et festum fatuorum</i> at St.
Apollinaire’s in Valence, but I cannot give the date<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>. At Vienne
the <i>Statutes</i> of St. Maurice, passed in 1385, forbid the <i>abbas
stultorum seu sociorum</i>, but apparently allow <i>rois</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> on the
Circumcision and Epiphany, as well as in the three post-Nativity
feasts. They also forbid certain <i>ludibria</i>. No <i>pasquinades</i>
are to be recited, and no one is to be carried <i>in Rost</i> or to
have his property put in pawn<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>. More can be said of the feast at
Viviers. A <i>Ceremonial</i> of 1365 contains minute directions for
its conduct<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>. On December 17 the <i>sclafardi et clericuli</i>
chose an <i>abbas stultus</i> to be responsible, as at Auxerre, for
the decorum of the choir throughout the year. He was shouldered and
borne to a place of honour at a drinking-bout. Here even the bishop,
if present, must do him honour. After the drinking, the company
divided into two parts, one composed of inferior clergy, the other
of dignitaries, and sang a doggerel song, each endeavouring to sing
its rival down. They shouted, hissed, howled, cackled, jeered and
gesticulated; and the victors mocked and flouted the vanquished. Then
the door-keeper made a proclamation on behalf of the ‘abbot,’ calling
on all to follow him, on pain of having their breeches slit, and the
whole crew rushed violently out of the church. A progress through the
town followed, which was repeated daily until Christmas eve<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>. On
the three post-Nativity feasts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span> a distinct <i>dominus festi</i>, the
<i>episcopus stultus</i>, apparently elected the previous year, took
the place of the <i>abbas</i>. On each of these days he presided at
Matins, Mass, and Vespers, sat in full pontificals on the bishop’s
throne, attended by his ‘chaplain,’ and gave the Benedictions. Both on
St. Stephen’s and St. John’s days these were followed by the recitation
of a burlesque formula of indulgence<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>. The whole festivity
seems to have concluded on Innocents’ day with the election of a new
<i>episcopus</i>, who, after the shouldering and the drinking-bout,
took his stand at a window of the great hall of the bishop’s palace,
and blessed the people of the city<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a>. The <i>episcopus</i> was
bound to give a supper to his fellows. In 1406 one William Raynoard
attempted to evade this obligation. An action was brought against him
in the court of the bishop’s official, by the then <i>abbas</i> and his
predecessor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span> It was referred to the arbitration of three canons, who
decided that Raynoard must give the supper on St. Bartholomew’s next,
August 24, at the accustomed place (a tavern, one fears) in the little
village of Gras, near Viviers<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there are examples of the Feast of Fools in Provence. At
Arles it was held in the church of St. Trophime, and is said to have
been presented, out of its due season, it may be supposed, for the
amusement of the Emperor Charles IV at his coronation in 1365, to have
scandalized him and so to have met its end<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>. Nevertheless in the
fifteenth century an ‘archbishop of Innocents,’ <i>alias stultus</i>,
still sang the ‘<i>O</i>’ on St. Thomas’s day, officiated on the days
of St. John and the Innocents, and on St. Trophime’s day (Dec. 29) paid
a visit to the <i>abadesse fole</i> of the convent of Saint-Césaire.
The real abbess of this convent was bound to provide chicken, bread and
wine for his regaling<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>. At Fréjus in 1558 an attempt to put down
the feast led to a riot. The bishop, Léon des Ursins, was threatened
with murder, and had to hide while his palace was stormed<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>. At Aix
the chapter of St. Saviour’s chose on St. Thomas’s day, an <i>episcopus
fatuus vel Innocentium</i> from the choir-boys. He officiated on
Innocents’ day, and boys and canons exchanged stalls. The custom lasted
until at least 1585<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>. Antibes, as late as 1645, affords a rare
example of the feast held by a religious house. It was on Innocents’
day in the church of the Franciscans. The choir and office were left
to the lay-brothers, the <i>quêteurs</i>, cooks and gardeners. These
put on the vestments inside out, held the books upside down, and wore
spectacles with rounds of orange peel instead of glasses. They blew the
ashes from the censers upon each other’s faces and heads, and instead
of the proper liturgy chanted confused and inarticulate gibberish. All
this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span> recorded by the contemporary free-thinker Mathurin de Neuré in
a letter to his leader and inspirer, Gassendi<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the range of the Feast of Fools in France, so
far as I have come across it, seems markedly to exclude the west and
south-west of the country. I have not been able to verify an alleged
exception at Bordeaux<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>. Possibly there is some ethnographical
reason for this. But on the whole, I am inclined to think that it is
an accident, and that a more complete investigation would disclose
a sufficiency of examples in this area. Outside France, the Feast
of Fools is of much less importance. The Spanish disciplinary
councils appear to make no specific mention of it, although they know
the cognate feast of the Boy Bishop, and more than once prohibit
<i>ludi</i>, <i>choreae</i>, and so forth, in general terms<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>.
In Germany, again, I do not know of a case in which the term ‘Fools’
is used. But the feast itself occurs sporadically. As early as the
twelfth century, Herrad von Landsberg, abbess of Hohenburg, complained
that miracle-plays, such as that of the <i>Magi</i>, instituted on
Epiphany and its octave by the Fathers of the Church, had given place
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span> licence, buffoonery and quarrelling. The priests came into the
churches dressed as knights, to drink and play in the company of
courtesans<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>. A Mosburg <i>Gradual</i> of 1360 contains a series
of <i>cantiones</i> compiled and partly written by the dean John von
Perchausen for use when the <i>scholarium episcopus</i> was chosen
at the Nativity<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>. Some of these, however, are shown by their
headings or by internal evidence to belong rather to a New Year’s day
feast, than to one on Innocents’ day<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>. A <i>festum baculi</i> is
mentioned and an <i>episcopus</i> or <i>praesul</i> who is chosen and
enthroned. One carol has the following refrain<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>:</p>

<p class="noindent">The reforms of the council of Basle were adopted
for Germany by the Emperor Albrecht II in the <i>Instrumentum
Acceptationis</i> of Mainz in 1439. In 1536 the council of Cologne,
quoting the decretal of Innocent III, condemned <i>theatrales ludi</i>
in churches. A Cologne <i>Ritual</i> preserves an account of the
sub-deacons’ feast upon the octave of Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>. The sub-deacons
were <i>hederaceo serto coronati</i>. Tapers were lit, and a <i>rex</i>
chosen, who acted as <i>hebdomarius</i> from first to second Vespers.
Carols were sung, as at Mosburg<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>.</p>

<p>John Huss, early in the fifteenth century, describes the Feast of Fools
as it existed in far-off Bohemia<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>. The revellers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> of whom, to
his remorse, Huss had himself been one as a lad, wore masks. A clerk,
grotesquely vested, was dubbed ‘bishop,’ set on an ass with his face to
the tail, and led to mass in the church. He was regaled on a platter
of broth and a bowl of beer, and Huss recalls the unseemly revel which
took place<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>. Torches were borne instead of candles, and the clergy
turned their garments inside out, and danced. These <i>ludi</i> had
been forbidden by one archbishop John of holy memory.</p>

<p>It would be surprising, in view of the close political and
ecclesiastical relations between mediaeval France and England, if the
Feast of Fools had not found its way across the channel. It did; but
apparently it never became so inveterate as successfully to resist
the disciplinary zeal of reforming bishops, and the few notices of it
are all previous to the end of the fourteenth century. It seems to
have lasted longest at Lincoln, and at Beverley. Of Lincoln, it will
be remembered, Pierre de Corbeil, the probable compiler of the Sens
<i>Officium</i>, was at one time coadjutor bishop. Robert Grosseteste,
whose attack upon the <i>Inductio Maii</i> and other village festivals
served as a starting-point for this discussion, was no less intolerant
of the Feast of Fools. In 1236 he forbade it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span> be held either in the
cathedral or elsewhere in the diocese<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>; and two years later he
included the prohibition in his formal <i>Constitutions</i><a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>. But
after another century and a half, when William Courtney, archbishop of
Canterbury, made a visitation of Lincoln in 1390, he found that the
vicars were still in the habit of disturbing divine service on January
1, in the name of the feast<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>. Probably his strict mandate put a
stop to the custom<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>. At almost precisely the same date the Feast
of Fools was forbidden by the statutes of Beverley minster, although
the sub-deacons and other inferior clergy were still to receive a
special commons on the day of the Circumcision<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>. Outside Lincoln
and Beverley, the feast is only known in England by the mention
of paraphernalia for it in thirteenth-century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span> inventories of St.
Paul’s<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>, and Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>, and by a doubtful allusion in a
sophisticated version of the St. George play<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the data concerning the Feast of Fools presented
in this and the preceding chapter is inevitable. It may be combined
with some indication of the relation in which the feast stands with
regard to the other feasts dealt with in the present volume. If we
look back to Belethus in the twelfth century we find him speaking of
the Feast of Fools as held on the Circumcision, on Epiphany or on the
octave of Epiphany, and as being specifically a feast of sub-deacons.
Later records bear out on the whole the first of these statements. As
a rule the feast focussed on the Circumcision, although the rejoicings
were often prolonged, and the election of the <i>dominus festi</i> in
some instances gave rise to a minor celebration on an earlier day.
Occasionally (Noyon, Laon) the Epiphany, once at least (Cologne)
the octave of the Epiphany, takes the place of the Circumcision.
But we also find the term Feast of Fools extended to cover one or
more of three feasts, distinguished from it by Belethus, which
immediately follow Christmas. Sometimes it includes them all three
(Besançon, Viviers, Vienne), sometimes the feast of the Innocents
alone (Autun, Avallon, Aix, Antibes, Arles), once the feast of St.
Stephen (Châlons-sur-Marne)<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>. On the other hand, the definition
of the feast as a sub-deacons’ feast is not fully applicable to its
later developments. Traces of a connexion with the sub-deacons appear
more than once (Amiens, Sens, Auxerre, Beverley); but as a rule the
feast is held by the inferior clergy known as vicars, chaplains, and
choir-clerks, all of whom are grouped at Viviers and Romans under
the general term of <i>esclaffardi</i>. At Laon a part is taken in
it by the <i>curés</i> of the various parishes in the city.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span> The
explanation is, I think, fairly obvious. Originally, perhaps, the
sub-deacons held the feast, just as the deacons, priests, and boys
held theirs in Christmas week. But it had its vogue mainly in the
great cathedrals served by secular canons<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>, and in these the
distinction between the canons in different orders—for a sub-deacon
might be a full canon<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a>—was of less importance than the difference
between the canons as a whole and the minor clergy who made up the
rest of the cathedral body, the hired choir-clerks, the vicars
choral who, originally at least, supplied the place in the choir of
absent canons, and the chaplains who served the chantries or small
foundations attached to the cathedral<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>. The status of spiritual
dignity gave way to the status of material preferment. And so, as
the vicars gradually coalesced into a corporation of their own, the
Feast of Fools passed into their hands, and became a celebration of
the annual election of the head of their body<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>. The vicars and
their associates were probably an ill-educated and an ill-paid class.
Certainly they were difficult to discipline<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>; and it is not
surprising that their rare holiday, of which the expenses were met
partly by the chapter, partly by dues levied upon themselves or upon
the bystanders<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>, was an occasion for popular rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span> than refined
merry-making<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>. That it should perpetuate or absorb folk-customs
was also, considering the peasant or small <i>bourgeois</i> extraction
of such men, quite natural.</p>

<p>The simple psychology of the last two sentences really gives the
key to the nature of the feast. It was largely an ebullition of the
natural lout beneath the cassock. The vicars hooted and sang improper
ditties, and played dice upon the altar, in a reaction from the wonted
restraints of choir discipline. Familiarity breeds contempt, and
it was almost an obvious sport to burlesque the sacred and tedious
ceremonies with which they were only too painfully familiar. Indeed,
the reverend founders and reformers of the feast had given a lead to
this apishness by the introduction of the symbolical transference of
the <i>baculus</i> at the <i>Deposuit</i> in the <i>Magnificat</i>.
The ruling idea of the feast is the inversion of status, and the
performance, inevitably burlesque, by the inferior clergy of functions
properly belonging to their betters. The fools jangle the bells
(Paris, Amiens, Auxerre), they take the higher stalls (Paris), sing
dissonantly (Sens), repeat meaningless words (Châlons, Antibes), say
the <i>messe liesse</i> (Laon) or the <i>missa fatuorum</i> (Autun),
preach the <i>sermones fatui</i> (Auxerre), cense <i>praepostere</i>
(St. Omer) with pudding and sausage (Beauvais) or with old shoes (Paris
theologians). They have their chapter and their proctors (Auxerre,
Dijon). They install their <i>dominus festi</i> with a ceremony of
<i>sacre</i> (Troyes), or shaving (Sens, Dijon). He is vested in
full pontificals, goes in procession, as at the <i>Rabardiaux</i> of
Laon, gives the benedictions, issues indulgences (Viviers), has his
seal (Lille), perhaps his right of coining (Laon). Much in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span> all these
proceedings was doubtless the merest horseplay; such ingenuity and
humour as they required may have been provided by the wicked wit of the

<p>Now I would point out that this inversion of status so characteristic
of the Feast of Fools is equally characteristic of folk-festivals.
What is Dr. Frazer’s mock king but one of the meanest of the people
chosen out to represent the real king as the priest victim of a
divine sacrifice, and surrounded, for the period of the feast, in
a naïve attempt to outwit heaven, with all the paraphernalia and
luxury of kingship? Precisely such a mock king is the <i>dominus
festi</i> with whom we have to do. His actual titles, indeed, are
generally ecclesiastical. Most often he is a ‘bishop,’ or ‘prelate’
(Senlis); in metropolitan churches an ‘archbishop,’ in churches exempt
from other authority than that of the Holy See, a ‘pope’ (Amiens,
Senlis, Chartres). More rarely he is a ‘patriarch’ (Laon, Avallon),
a ‘cardinal’ (Paris, Besançon), an ‘abbot’ (Vienne, Viviers, Romans,
Auxerre)<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>, or is even content with the humbler dignity of
‘precentor,’ ‘<i>bacularius</i>’ or ‘<i>bâtonnier</i>’ (Sens, Dijon).
At Autun he is, quite exceptionally, ‘Herod.’ Nevertheless the term
‘king’ is not unknown. It is found at Noyon, at Vienne, at Besançon,
at Beverley, and the council of Basle testifies to its use, as well
as that of ‘duke.’ Nor is it, after all, of much importance what the
<i>dominus festi</i> is called. The point is that his existence and
functions in the ecclesiastical festivals afford precise parallels to
his existence and functions in folk-festivals all Europe over.</p>

<p>Besides the ‘king’ many other features of the folk-festivals may
readily be traced at the Feast of Fools. Some here, some there,
they jot up in the records. There are dance and <i>chanson</i>,
<i>tripudium</i> and <i>cantilena</i> (Noyon, Châlons-sur-Marne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
Paris theologians, council of Basle). There is eating and drinking,
not merely in the refectory, but within or at the doors of the church
itself (Paris theologians, Beauvais, Prague). There is ball-playing
(Châlons-sur-Marne). There is the procession or cavalcade through the
streets (Laon, Châlons-sur-Marne, &amp;c.). There are torches and lanterns
(Sens, Tournai). Men are led <i>nudi</i> (Sens); they are whipped
(Tours); they are ceremonially ducked or roasted (Sens, Tournai,
Vienne, <i>les Gaigizons</i> at Autun)<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>. A comparison with
earlier chapters of the present volume will establish the significance
which these points, taken in bulk, possess. Equally characteristic of
folk-festivals is the costume considered proper to the feasts. The
riotous clergy wear their vestments inside out (Antibes), or exchange
dress with the laity (Lincoln, Paris theologians). But they also wear
leaves or flowers (Sens, Laon, Cologne) and women’s dress (Paris
theologians); and above all they wear hideous and monstrous masks,
<i>larvae</i> or <i>personae</i> (decretal of 1207, Paris theologians,
council of Basle, Paris, Soissons, Laon, Lille). These masks, indeed,
are perhaps the one feature of the feast which called down the most
unqualified condemnation from the ecclesiastical authorities. We shall
not be far wrong if we assume them to have been beast-masks, and to
have taken the place of the actual skins and heads of sacrificial
animals, here, as so often, worn at the feast by the worshippers.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to find an oriental origin for the Feast
of Fools<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>. Gibbon relates the insults offered to the church
at Constantinople by the Emperor Michael III, the ‘Drunkard’
(842-67)<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>. A noisy crew of courtiers dressed themselves in the
sacred vestments. One Theophilus or Grylus, captain of the guard, a
mime and buffoon, was chosen as a mock ‘patriarch.’ The rest were his
twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span> ‘metropolitans,’ Michael himself being entitled ‘metropolitan
of Cologne.’ The ‘divine mysteries’ were burlesqued with vinegar and
mustard in a golden cup set with gems. Theophilus rode about the
streets of the city on a white ass, and when he met the real patriarch
Ignatius, exposed him to the mockery of the revellers. After the
death of Michael, this profanity was solemnly anathematized by the
council of Constantinople held under his successor Basil in 869<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>.
Theophilus, though he borrowed the vestments for his mummery, seems
to have carried it on in the streets and the palace, not in the
church. In the tenth century, however, the patriarch Theophylactus
won an unenviable reputation by admitting dances and profane songs
into the ecclesiastical festivals<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a>; while in the twelfth, the
patriarch Balsamon describes his own unavailing struggle against
proceedings at Christmas and Candlemas, which come uncommonly near
the Feast of Fools. The clergy of St. Sophia’s, he says, claim as of
ancient custom to wear masks, and to enter the church in the guise of
soldiers, or of monks, or of four-footed animals. The superintendents
snap their fingers like charioteers, or paint their faces and mimic
women. The rustics are moved to laughter by the pouring of wine into
pitchers, and are allowed to chant <i>Kyrie eleison</i> in ludicrous
iteration at every verse<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>. Balsamon, who died in 1193, was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
precisely a contemporary of Belethus, and the earlier Byzantine
notices considerably ante-date any records that we possess of the
Feast of Fools in the West. A slight corroboration of this theory of
an eastern origin may be derived from the use of the term ‘patriarch’
for the <i>dominus festi</i> at Laon and Avallon. It would, I think,
be far-fetched to find another in the fact that Theophilus, like the
western ‘bishops’ of Fools, rode upon an ass, and that the <i>Prose de
l’Âne</i> begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Orientis partibus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">adventavit asinus.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In any case, the oriental example can hardly be
responsible for more than the admission of the feast within the doors
of the church. One cannot doubt that it was essentially an adaptation
of a folk-custom long perfectly well known in the West itself. The
question of origin had already presented itself to the learned writers
of the thirteenth century. William of Auxerre, by a misunderstanding
which I shall hope to explain, traced the Feast of Fools to the Roman
<i>Parentalia</i>: Durandus, and the Paris theologians after him,
to the January Kalends. Certainly Durandus was right. The Kalends,
unlike the more specifically Italian feasts, were co-extensive with
the Roman empire, and were naturally widespread in Gaul. The date
corresponds precisely with that by far the most common for the Feast
of Fools. A singular history indeed, that of the ecclesiastical
celebration of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> First of January. Up to the eighth century a fast,
with its mass <i>pro prohibendo ab idolis</i>, it gradually took
on a festal character, and became ultimately the one feast in the
year in which paganism made its most startling and persistent recoil
upon Christianity. The attacks upon the Kalends in the disciplinary
documents form a catena which extends very nearly to the point at which
the notices of the Feast of Fools begin. In each alike the masking, in
mimicry of beasts and probably of beast-gods or ‘demons,’ appears to
have been a prominent and highly reprobated feature. It is true that
we hear nothing of a <i>dominus festi</i> at the Kalends; but much
stress must not be laid upon the omission of the disciplinary writers
to record any one point in a custom which after all they were not
describing as anthropologists, and it would certainly be an exceptional
Germano-Keltic folk-feast which had not a <i>dominus</i>. As a matter
of fact, there is no mention of a <i>rex</i> in the accounts of the
pre-Christian Kalends in Italy itself. There was a <i>rex</i> at the
<i>Saturnalia</i>, and this, together with an allusion of Belethus in
a quite different connexion to the <i>libertas Decembrica</i><a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>,
has led some writers to find in the <i>Saturnalia</i>, rather than the
Kalends, the origin of the Feast of Fools<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>. This is, I venture to
think, wrong. The <i>Saturnalia</i> were over well before December 25:
there is no evidence that they had a vogue outside Italy: the Kalends,
like the <i>Saturnalia</i>, were an occasion at which slaves met their
masters upon equal terms, and I believe that the existence of a Kalends
<i>rex</i>, both in Italy and in Gaul, may be taken for granted.</p>

<p>But the parallel between Kalends and the Feast of Fools cannot be held
to be quite perfect, unless we can trace in the latter feast that most
characteristic of all Kalends customs, the <i>Cervulus</i>. Is it
possible that a representative of the <i>Cervulus</i> is to be found
in the Ass, who, whether introduced from Constantinople or not, gave
to the Feast of Fools one of its popular names? The Feast of Asses
has been the sport of controversialists who had not, and were at no
great pains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span> to have, the full facts before them. I do not propose to
awake once more these ancient angers<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>. The facts themselves are
briefly these. The ‘Prose of the Ass’ was used at Bourges, at Sens,
and at Beauvais. As to the Bourges feast I have no details. At Sens,
the use of the Prose by Pierre de Corbeil is indeed no proof that he
allowed an ass to appear in the ceremony. But the Prose would not have
much point unless it was at least a survival from a time when an ass
did appear; the feast was known as the <i>asinaria festa</i>; and
even now, three centuries after it was abolished, the Sens choir-boys
still play at being <i>âne</i> archbishop on Innocents’ day<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>. At
Beauvais the heading <i>Conductus quando asinus adducitur</i> in the
thirteenth-century <i>Officium</i> seems to show that there at least
the ass appeared, and even entered the church. The document, also of
the thirteenth century, quoted by the editors of Ducange, certainly
brings him, in the ceremony of January 14, into the church and near
the altar. An imitation of his braying is introduced into the service
itself. At Autun the leading of an ass <i>ad processionem</i>, and
the <i>cantilena super dictum asinum</i> were suppressed in 1411. At
Châlons-sur-Marne in 1570 an ass bore the ‘bishop’ to the theatre at
the church door only. At Prague, on the other hand, towards the end of
the fourteenth century, an ass was led, as at Beauvais, right into the
church. These, with doubtful references to <i>fêtes des ânes</i> at
St. Quentin about 1081, at Béthune in 1474, and at Laon in 1527, and
the Mosburg description of the ‘bishop’ as <i>asinorum dominus</i>,
are all the cases I have found in which an ass has anything to do
with the feast. But they are enough to prove that an ass was an early
and widespread, though not an invariable feature. I may quote here a
curious survival in a <i>ronde</i> from the west of France, said to
have been sung at church doors on January 1<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>. It is called <i>La
Mort de l’Âne</i>, and begins:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This, like the Sens choir-boys’ custom of calling their
‘archbishop’ <i>âne</i>, would seem to suggest that the <i>dominus
festi</i> was himself the ass, with a mask on; and this may have been
sometimes the case. But in most of the mediaeval instances the ass was
probably used to ride. At Prague, so far as one can judge from Huss’s
description, he was a real ass. There is no proof in any of the French
examples that he was, or was not, merely a ‘hobby-ass.’ If he was, he
came all the nearer to the <i>Cervulus</i>.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out, and will, in the next volume, be pointed
out again, that the ecclesiastical authorities attempted to sanctify
the spirit of play at the Feast of Fools and similar festivities
by diverting the energies of the revellers to <i>ludi</i> of the
miracle-play order. In such <i>ludi</i> they found a place for the ass.
He appears for instance as Balaam’s ass in the later versions from
Laon and Rouen of the <i>Prophetae</i>, and at Rouen he gave to the
whole of this performance the name of the <i>festum</i> or <i>processio
asinorum</i><a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>. At Hamburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span> by a curious combination, he is at
once Balaam’s ass and the finder of the star in a <i>ludus Trium
Regum</i><a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>. His use as the mount of the Virgin on January 14 at
Beauvais, and on some uncertain day at Sens, seems to suggest another
favourite episode in such <i>ludi</i>, that of the Flight into Egypt.
At Varennes, in Picardy, and at Bayonne, exist carved wooden groups
representing this event. That of Varennes is carried in procession;
that of Bayonne is the object of pilgrimage on the <i>fêtes</i> of the
Virgin<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>.</p>

<p>Not at the Feast of Fools alone, or at the miracle-plays connected
with this feast, did the ass make its appearance in Christian worship.
It stood with the ox, on the morning of the Nativity, beside the
Christmas crib. On Palm Sunday it again formed part of a procession,
in the semblance of the beast on which Christ made his triumphal entry
into Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>. A Cambrai <i>Ordinarium</i> quoted by Ducange
directs that the <i>asina picta</i> shall remain behind the altar
for four days<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>. Kirchmeyer describes the custom as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span> existed
during the sixteenth century in Germany<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>; and the stray tourist
who drops into the wonderful collection of domestic and ecclesiastical
antiquities in the Barfüsserkirche at Basle will find there three
specimens of the <i>Palmesel</i>, including a thirteenth-century one
from Bayern and a seventeenth-century one from Elsass. The third is not
labelled with its <i>provenance</i>, but it is on wheels and has a hole
for the rope by which it was dragged round the church. All three are of
painted wood, and upon each is a figure representing Christ<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>.</p>

<p>The affiliation of the ecclesiastical New Year revelries to the
pagan Kalends does not explain why those who took part in them were
called ‘Fools.’ The obvious thing to say is that they were called
‘Fools’ because they played the fool; and indeed their mediaeval
critics were not slow to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span> draw this inference. But it is noteworthy
that pagan Rome already had its Feast of Fools, which, indeed,
had nothing to do with the Kalends. The <i>stultorum feriae</i>
on February 17 was the last day on which the <i>Fornacalia</i> or
ritual sacrifice of the <i>curiae</i> was held. Upon it all the
<i>curiae</i> sacrificed in common, and it therefore afforded an
opportunity for any citizen who did not know which his <i>curia</i>
was to partake in the ceremony<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>. I am not prepared to say
that the <i>stultorum feriae</i> gave its name to the Feast of
Fools; but the identity of the two names certainly seems to explain
some of the statements which mediaeval scholars make about that
feast. It explains William of Auxerre’s derivation of it from the
<i>Parentalia</i>, for the <i>stultorum feriae</i> fell in the midst
of the <i>Parentalia</i><a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>. And I think it explains the remark
of Belethus, and, following him, of Durandus, about the <i>ordo
subdiaconorum</i> being <i>incertus</i>. The sub-deacons were a regular
<i>ordo</i>, the highest of the <i>ordines minores</i> from the third
century<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>. But Belethus seems to be struggling with the notion that
the sub-deacons’ feast, closing the series of post-Nativity feasts held
by deacons, priests and choir-boys, was in some way parallel to the
<i>feriae</i> of the Roman <i>stulti</i> who were <i>incerti</i> as to
their <i>curia</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—Most of the authorities for chh.
xiii, xiv, are still available, since many writers have not
been careful to distinguish between the various feasts of the
Twelve nights. The best modern account of the Boy Bishop is Mr.
A. F. Leach’s paper on <i>The Schoolboys’ Feast</i> in <i>The
Fortnightly Review</i>, N. S. lix (1896), 128. The contributions
of F. A. Dürr, <i>Commentatio Historica de Episcopo Puerorum,

des Unterrichtswesens in Deutschland</i>, 222 sqq. (1885); A.

35 sqq. (1893); E. F. Rimbault, <i>The Festival of the Boy
Bishop in England</i> in <i>The Camden Miscellany</i>, vol. vii
(Camden Soc. 1875), are also valuable. Dr. Rimbault speaks of
‘considerable collections for a history of the festival of the
Boy Bishop throughout Europe,’ made by Mr. J. G. Nichols, but I
do not know where these are to be found. Brand (ed. Ellis), i.
227 sqq., has some miscellaneous data, and a notice interesting
by reason of its antiquity is that on the <i>Episcopus Puerorum,
in Die Innocentium</i>, in the <i>Posthuma</i>, 95 sqq., of John
Gregory (1649).]</p>
</div>


<p>Joannes Belethus, the learned theologian of Paris and Amiens, towards
the end of the twelfth century, describes, as well as the Feast of
Fools, no less than three other <i>tripudia</i> falling in Christmas
week<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>. Upon the days of St. Stephen, St. John the Evangelist, and
the Holy Innocents, the deacons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span> the priests, the choir-boys, held
their respective revels, each body in turn claiming that pre-eminence
in the divine services which in the Feast of Fools was assigned to the
sub-deacons. The distinction drawn by Belethus is not wholly observed
in the ecclesiastical prohibitions either of the thirteenth or of the
fifteenth century. In many of these the term ‘Feast of Fools’ has a
wide meaning. The council of Nevers in 1246 includes under it the
feasts of the Innocents and the New Year; that of Langres in 1404
the ‘festivals of the Nativity’; that of Nantes in 1431 the Nativity
itself, St. Stephen’s, St. John’s, and the Innocents’. For the council
of Basle it is apparently synonymous with the ‘Feast of Innocents or
Boys’; the Paris theologians speak of its rites as practised on St.
Stephen’s, the Innocents’, the Circumcision, and other dates. The same
tendency to group all these <i>tripudia</i> together recurs in passages
in which the ‘Feast of Fools’ is not in so many words mentioned.
The famous decretal of Pope Innocent III is directed against the
<i>ludibria</i> practised in turns by deacons, priests, and sub-deacons
during the feasts immediately following upon Christmas. The <i>irrisio
servitii</i> inveighed against in the <i>Rememoratio</i> of Gerson took
place on Innocents’ day, on the Circumcision, on the Epiphany, or at
Shrovetide.</p>

<p>Local usage, however, only partly bears out this loose language of
the prohibitions. At Châlons-sur-Marne, in 1570, the ‘bishop’ of
Fools sported on St. Stephen’s day. At Besançon, in 1387, a distinct
<i>dominus festi</i> was chosen on each of the three days after
Christmas, and all alike were called <i>rois des fous</i>. At Autun,
during the fifteenth century, the <i>regna</i> of the ‘bishop’ and
‘dean’ of Innocents and of ‘Herod’ at the New Year were known together
as the <i>festa folorum</i>. Further south, the identification is
perhaps more common. At Avallon, Aix, Antibes, the Feast of Fools was
on Innocents’ day; at Arles the <i>episcopus stultorum</i> officiated
both on the Innocents’ and on St. John’s, at Viviers on all three of
the post-Nativity feasts. But these are exceptions, and, at least
outside Provence, the rule seems to have been to apply the name of
‘Feast of Fools’ to the <i>tripudium</i>, originally that of the
sub-deacons, on New Year’s day or the Epiphany, and to distinguish from
this, as does Belethus, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span> <i>tripudia</i> of the deacons, priests,
and choir-boys in Christmas week.</p>

<p>We may go further and say, without much hesitation, that the three
latter feasts are of older ecclesiastical standing than their riotous
rival. Belethus is the first writer to mention the Feast of Fools,
but he is by no means the first writer to mention the Christmas
<i>tripudia</i>. They were known to Honorius of Autun<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>, early
in the twelfth century, and to John of Avranches<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>, late in the
eleventh. They can be traced at least from the beginning of the tenth,
more than two hundred and fifty years before the Feast of Fools is
heard of. The earliest notice I have come across is at the monastery
of St. Gall, hard by Constance, in 911. In that year King Conrad I
was spending Christmas with Bishop Solomon of Constance. He heard
so much of the Vespers processions during the <i>triduum</i> at St.
Gall that he insisted on visiting the monastery, and arrived there
in the midst of the revels. It was all very amusing, and especially
the procession of children, so grave and sedate that even when Conrad
bade his train roll apples along the aisle they did not budge<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>.
That the other Vespers processions of the <i>triduum</i> were of
deacons and priests may be taken for granted. I do not know whether
the <i>triduum</i> originated at St. Gall, but the famous song-school
of that monastery was all-important in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span> the movement towards the
greater elaboration of church ceremonial, and even more of chant, which
marked the tenth century. This gave rise to the tropes, of which much
will be said in the next volume; and it is in a tropary, an English
tropary from Winchester, dating from before 980, that the feasts of
the <i>triduum</i> next occur. The ceremonies of those feasts, as
described by Belethus, belong mainly to the Office, and the tropes
are mainly chanted elaborations of the text of the Mass: but the
Winchester tropes for the days of St. Stephen, St. John, and the Holy
Innocents clearly imply the respective connexion of the services, to
which they belong, with deacons, priests, and choir-boys<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>. Of the
sub-deacons, on Circumcision or Epiphany, there is as yet nothing. John
of Avranches, Honorius of Autun, and Belethus bridge a gap, and from
the thirteenth century the <i>triduum</i> is normal in service-books,
both continental and English, throughout the Middle Ages<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>. It is
provided for in the Nantes <i>Ordinarium</i> of 1263<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>, in the
Amiens <i>Ordinarium</i> of 1291<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>, and in the Tours <i>Rituale</i>
of the fourteenth century<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>. It required reforming at Vienne in
1385, but continued to exist there up to 1670<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>. In the last three
cases it is clearly marked side by side with, but other than, the Feast
of Fools. In Germany, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span> is contemplated in the <i>Ritual</i> of
Mainz<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a>. In England I trace it at Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>,
    at York<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>,
at Lincoln<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>, at St. Albans<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>.
    These instances could doubtless
be multiplied, although there were certainly places where the special
devotion of the three feasts to the three bodies dropped out at an
early date. The Rheims <i>Ordinarium</i> of the fourteenth century,
for instance, knows nothing of it<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a>. The extent of the ceremonies,
again, would naturally be subject to local variation. The germ of them
lay in the procession at first Vespers described by Ekkehard at St.
Gall. But they often grew to a good deal more than this. The deacons,
priests, or choir-boys, as the case might be, took the higher stalls,
and the whole conduct of the services; the <i>Deposuit</i> was sung;
<i>epistolae farcitae</i> were read<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>; there was a <i>dominus
festi</i>.</p>

<p>The main outlines of the feasts of the <i>triduum</i> are thus almost
exactly parallel, so far as the divine <i>servitium</i> is concerned,
to those of the Feast of Fools, for which indeed they probably served
as a model. And like the Feast of Fools, they had their secular side,
which often became riotousness. Occasionally they were absorbed in,
or overshadowed by, the more popular and wilder merry-making of
the inferior clergy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span> But elsewhere they have their own history of
reformations or suppression, or are grouped with the Feast of Fools,
as by the decretal of Innocent III, in a common condemnation. The
diversity of local practice is well illustrated by the records of such
acts of discipline. Sometimes, as at Paris<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>, or Soissons<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>,
it is the deacons’ feast alone that has become an abuse; sometimes,
as at Worms, that of the priests’<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>; sometimes two of them<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>,
sometimes all three<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>, require correction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span> I need only refer
more particularly to two interesting English examples. One is at
Wells, where a chapter statute of about 1331 condemns the tumult
and <i>ludibrium</i> with which divine service was celebrated from
the Nativity to the octave of the Innocents, and in particular the
<i>ludi theatrales</i> and <i>monstra larvarum</i> introduced into
the cathedral by the deacons, priests, sub-deacons, and even vicars
during this period<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a>. Nor was the abuse easy to check, for about
1338 a second statute was required to reinforce and strengthen the
prohibition<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>. So, too, in the neighbouring diocese of Exeter. The
register of Bishop Grandisson records the mandates against <i>ludi
inhonesti</i> addressed by him in 1360 to the chapters of Exeter
cathedral, and of the collegiate churches of Ottery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span> Crediton,
and Glasney. These <i>ludi</i> were performed by men and boys at
Vespers, Matins, and Mass on Christmas and the three following days.
They amounted to a mockery of the divine worship, did much damage
to the church vestments and ornaments, and brought the clergy into
disrepute<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>. These southern prohibitions are shortly before the
final suppression of the Feast of Fools in the north at Beverley
and Lincoln. The Wells customs, indeed, probably included a regular
Feast of Fools, for the part taken by the sub-deacons and vicars is
specifically mentioned, and the proceedings lasted over the New Year.
But it is clear that even where the term ‘Feast of Fools’ is not known
to have been in use, the temper of that revel found a ready vent in
other of the winter rejoicings. Nor was it the <i>triduum</i> alone
which afforded its opportunities. More rarely the performances of the
<i>Pastores</i> on Christmas day itself<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>, or the suppers given by
the great officers of cathedrals and monasteries, when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span> sang their
‘<i>Oes</i>,’ on the nights between December 16 and Christmas<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a>,
were the occasions for excesses which called for reprehension.</p>

<p>Already, when Conrad visited St. Gall in 911, the third feast of the
<i>triduum</i> was the most interesting. In after years this reached an
importance denied to the other two. The Vespers procession was the germ
of an annual rejoicing, secular as well as ritual, which became for
the <i>pueri</i> attached as choir-boys and servers to the cathedrals
and great churches very much what the Feast of Fools became for the
adult inferior clergy of the same bodies. Where the two feasts were
not merged in one, this distinction of <i>personnel</i> was retained.
A good example is afforded by Sens. Here, from the middle of the
fourteenth century, the chapter accounts show an <i>archiepiscopus
puerorum</i> side by side with the <i>dominus</i> of the Feast of
Fools. Each feast got its own grant of wine from the chapter, and had
its own prebend in the chapter woods. In the fifteenth century the two
fell and rose together. In the sixteenth, the Feast of Boys was the
more flourishing, and claimed certain dues from a market in Sens, which
were commuted for a small money payment by the chapter. Finally, both
feasts are suppressed together in 1547<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>. It is to be observed that
the original celebration of the Holy Innocents’ day in the western
Church was not of an unmixed festal character. It commemorated a
martyrdom which typified and might actually have been that of Christ
himself, and it was therefore held <i>cum tristitia</i>. As in Lent or
on Good Friday itself, the ‘joyful chants,’ such as the <i>Te Deum</i>
or the <i>Alleluia</i>, were silenced. This characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span> of the day
was known to Belethus, but even before his time it had begun to give
way to the festal tendencies. Local practice differed widely, as the
notices collected by Martene show, but even when John of Avranches
wrote, at the end of the eleventh century, the ‘modern’ custom was to
sing the chants<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a>.</p>

<p>Many interesting details of the Feast of Boys, as it was celebrated
in France, are contained in various ceremonial books. The <i>Officium
Infantum</i> of Rouen may be taken as typical<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a>. After second
Vespers on St. John’s day the boys marched out of the vestry, two by
two, with their ‘bishop,’ singing <i>Centum quadraginta</i>. There
was a procession to the altar of the Holy Innocents, and <i>Hi empti
sunt</i> was sung<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>. Then the ‘bishop’ gave the Benediction. The
feast of the following day was ‘double,’ but the boys might make it
‘triple,’ if they would. There was a procession, with the <i>Centum
quadraginta</i>, at Matins. At Mass, the boys led the choir. At Vespers
the <i>baculus</i> was handed over, while the <i>Deposuit potentes</i>
was being sung<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>. At Bayeux the feast followed the same general
lines, but the procession at first Vespers was to the altar, not of
the Holy Innocents, but of St. Nicholas<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>. Precise directions are
given as to the functions of the ‘bishop.’ He is to wear a silk tunic
and cope, and to have a mitre and pastoral staff, but not a ring.
The boys are to do him the same reverence that is done to the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
bishop. There are also to be a boy <i>cantor</i> and a boy ‘chaplain.’
The ‘bishop’ is to perform the duties of a priest, so long as the
feast lasts, except in the Mass. He is to give the benediction after
<i>Benedicamus</i> at first Vespers. Then the boys are to take the
higher stalls, and to keep them throughout the following day, the
‘bishop’ sitting in the dean’s chair. The boys are to say Compline
as they will. The ‘bishop’ is to be solemnly conducted home with the
prose <i>Sedentem</i>, and on the following day he is to be similarly
conducted both to and from service. At Mass he is to cense and be
censed like the ‘great bishop’ on solemn occasions. He is also to
give the benediction at Mass. There is a minute description of the
ceremony of <i>Deposuit</i>, from which it is clear that, at Bayeux
at least, the handing over of the <i>baculus</i> was from an incoming
to an outgoing ‘bishop,’ to whom the former was in turn to act as
‘chaplain<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>.’ The rubrics of the Coutances feast are even more
minute<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>. The proceedings began after Matins on St. John’s day,
when the boys drew up a <i>tabula</i> appointing their superiors to
the minor offices of the coming feast. This, however, they were to do
without impertinence<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a>. The vesting of the ‘bishop’ and the Vespers
procession are exactly described. As at Bayeux the boys take the high
stalls for Compline. The canon who holds a particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span> prebend is bound
to carry the candle and the <i>collectarium</i> for the ‘bishop.’
After Compline the ‘bishop’ is led home with <i>Laetabundus</i>, but
not in pontificals. Throughout the services of the following day
the ‘bishop’ plays his part, and when Vespers comes gives way to a
‘bishop’-elect at the <i>Deposuit</i><a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>. The ‘bishop’ of St.
Martin of Tours was installed in the neighbouring convent of Beaumont,
whither all the <i>clericuli</i> rode for the purpose after Prime on
St. John’s day. He was vested in the church there, blessed the nuns,
then returned to Tours, was installed in his own cathedral, and blessed
the populace<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>. The secular side of the feast comes out in the Toul
<i>Statutes</i> of 1497<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>. Here it may be said to have absorbed in
its turn the Feast of Fools, for the ‘bishop’ was a choir-boy chosen
by the choir-boys themselves and also by the sub-deacons, who shared
with them the name of <i>Innocentes</i><a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>. The election took
place after Compline on the first Sunday in Advent, and the ‘bishop’
was enthroned with a <i>Te Deum</i>. He officiated in the usual way
throughout the Innocents’ day services. In the morning he rode at the
head of a <i>cortège</i> to the monasteries of St. Mansuetus and St.
Aper, sang an anthem and said a prayer at the door of each church, and
claimed a customary fee<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>. After Vespers he again rode in state
with mimes and trumpeters through the city<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>. On the following
day, all the ‘Innocents’ went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span> masked into the city, where, if it was
fine enough, farces and apparently also moralities and miracles were
played<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>. On the octave the ‘bishop’ and his <i>cortège</i> went to
the church of St. Geneviève. After an anthem and collect they adjourned
to the ‘church-house,’ where they were entertained by the hospital at a
dessert of cake, apples and nuts, during which they chose disciplinary
officers for the coming year<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a>. The expenses of the feast, with
the exception of the dinner on the day after Innocents’ day which came
out of the disciplinary fines, are assigned by the statutes to the
canons in the order of their appointment. The responsible canon must
give a supper on Innocents’ day, and a dessert out of what is over on
the following day. He must also provide the ‘bishop’ with a horse,
gloves, and a <i>biretta</i> when he rides abroad. At the supper a
curious ceremony took place. The canon returned thanks to the ‘bishop,’
apologized for any short-comings in the preparations, and finally
handed the ‘bishop’ a cap of rosemary or other flowers, which was then
conferred upon the canon to whose lot it would fall to provide the
feast for the next anniversary<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>. Should the canon disregard his
duties the boys and sub-deacons were entitled to hang up a black cope
on a candlestick in the middle of the choir <i>in illius vituperium</i>
for as long as they might choose<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>I cannot pretend to give a complete account of all the French
examples of the Boy Bishop with which I have met, and it is the less
necessary, as the feast seems to have been far more popular and
enduring in England than the Feast of Fools. I content myself with
giving references for its history at Amiens<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a>, St. Quentin<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a>,
Senlis<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a>, Soissons<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>,
    Roye<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>, Peronne<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a>,
    Rheims<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>,
Brussels<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>, Lille<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a>,
    Liège<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>, Laon<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a>,
    Troyes<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>,
Mans<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a>, Bourges<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>,
    Châlons-sur-Saône<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a>, Grenoble<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>. Not
unnaturally it proved less of a scandal to ecclesiastical reformers
than the Feast of Fools; for the choir-boys must have been more
amenable to discipline, even in moments of festivity, than the adult
clerks. But it shared in the general condemnation of all such customs,
and was specifically arraigned by more than one council, rather perhaps
for puerility than for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span> any graver offence<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>. Gradually therefore,
it vanished, leaving only a few survivals to recent centuries<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a>.
As was the case with the Feast of Fools, the question of its
suppression sometimes set a chapter by the ears. Notably was this so
at Noyon, where the act of his reforming colleagues in 1622 was highly
disapproved of by the dean, Jacques Le Vasseur. In a letter written on
the occasion he declares that the Boy Bishop had flourished in Noyon
cathedral for four hundred years, and brands the reformers as brute
beasts masquerading in the robes and beards of philosophy<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>.</p>

<p>I have no special records of the Boy Bishop in Spain except the council
decrees already quoted. In Germany he appears to have been more
widely popular than his rival of Fools. My first notice, however, is
two centuries after the visit of Conrad to the <i>triduum</i> at St.
Gall. The chronicle of the monastery of St. Petersburg, hard by Halle,
mentions an accident <i>in ludo qui vocatur puerorum</i>, by which a
lad was trodden to death. This was in 1137<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>. The thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries yield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span> more examples. In 1249 Pope Innocent IV
complained to the bishop of Ratisbon that the clerks and scholars of
that cathedral, when choosing their anniversary ‘bishop,’ did violence
to the abbey of Pruviningen<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>. In 1357 the Ratisbon feast was
stained with homicide, and was consequently suppressed<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a>. In 1282
the feast was forbidden at Eichstädt<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>. In 1304 it led to a dispute
between the municipality and the chapter of Hamburg, which ended in a
promise by the <i>scholares</i> to refrain from defamatory songs either
in Latin or German<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>. Similarly at Worms in 1307 the <i>pueri</i>
were forbidden to sing in the streets after Compline, as had been the
custom on the feasts of St. Nicholas and St. Lucy, on Christmas and the
three following days, and on the octave of the Holy Innocents’<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>.
At Lübeck the feast was abolished in 1336<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a>. I have already quoted
the long reference to the <i>scholarium episcopus</i> in the Mosburg
Gradual of 1360<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>. He may be traced also at Regensburg<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> and
at Prague<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>. But the fullest account of him is from Mainz<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a>.
Here he was called the <i>Schul-Bischoff</i>, and in derision
<i>Apffeln-Bischoff</i>. He was chosen before St. Nicholas’ day by
the <i>ludi magister</i> of the <i>schola trivialis</i>. He had his
<i>equites</i>, his <i>capellani</i>, and his <i>pedelli</i>. On St.
Nicholas’ day, and on that of the Holy Innocents’, he had a seat near
the high altar, and took part in the first and second Vespers. In
the interval he paid a visit with his company to the palace of the
elector, sang a hymn<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>, and claimed a banquet or a donation. The
custom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span> was not altogether extinct in Mainz by 1779<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>. In other
German towns, also, it well outlived the Middle Ages. At Cologne, for
instance, it was only suppressed by the statutes of Bishop Max Heinrich
in 1662<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a>.</p>

<p>In England, the Boy Bishop weathered the storms of discipline which
swept away the Feast of Fools in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. He was widely popular in the later Middle Ages, and finally
fell before an austerity of the Reformation. The prerogative instance
of the custom is in the church of Salisbury. Here the existence of the
Boy Bishop is already implied by the notice of a ring for use at the
‘Feast of Boys’ in an inventory of 1222<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a>. A century later, the
statutes of Roger de Mortival in 1319 include elaborate regulations
for the ceremony. The ‘bishop’ may perform the <i>officium</i> as
is the use, but he must hold no banquet, and no visitation either
within or without the cathedral. He may be invited to the table of
a canon, but otherwise he must remain in the common house, and must
return to his duties in church and school immediately after the feast
of Innocents. The statute also regulates the behaviour of the crowds
which were wont to press upon and impede the boys in their annual
procession to the altar of the Holy Trinity, and the rest of their
ministry<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>. Two of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span> great service-books of the Sarum use, the
Breviary and the Processional, give ample details as to the ‘ministry’
of the Boy Bishop and his fellows. The office, as preserved in these,
will be found in an appendix<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a>. The proceedings differ in some
respects from the continental models already described. There is no
mention of the <i>Deposuit</i>; and the central rite is still the
great procession between Vespers and Compline on the eve of the Holy
Innocents. This procession went from the choir either to the altar of
the Holy Innocents or to that of the Holy Trinity and All Saints in
the Lady chapel, and at its return the boys took the higher stalls and
kept them until the second Vespers of the feast. For this procession
the boys were entitled to assign the functions of carrying the book,
the censer, the candles, and so forth to the canons. Some miscellaneous
notices of the Salisbury feast are contained in the chapter register
between 1387 and 1473. From 1387 the oblations on the feast appear to
have been given to the ‘bishop.’ In 1413 he was allowed a banquet. In
1448 the precentor, Nicholas Upton, proposed that the boys, instead
of freely electing a ‘bishop,’ should be confined to a choice amongst
three candidates named by the chapter. But this innovation was
successfully resisted<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>. Cathedral documents also give the names
of twenty-one boys who held the office<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>. There is in Salisbury
cathedral a dwarf effigy of a bishop, dating from the latter part of
the thirteenth century. Local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span> tradition, from at least the beginning
of the seventeenth century, has regarded this as the monument of a Boy
Bishop who died during his term of office. But modern archaeologists
repudiate the theory. Such miniature effigies are not uncommon, and
possibly indicate that the heart alone of the person commemorated is
buried in the spot which they mark<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a>.</p>

<p>The gradual adoption of the use of Sarum by other dioceses would
naturally tend to carry with it that of the Boy Bishop. But he is
to be found at Exeter and at St. Paul’s before the change of use,
as well as at Lincoln and York which retained their own uses up to
the Reformation. At Exeter Bishop Grandisson’s <i>Ordinale</i> of
1337 provides an <i>Officium puerorum</i> for the eve and day of the
Innocents which, with different detail, is on the same general lines
as that of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a>. At St. Paul’s there was a Boy Bishop about
1225, when a gift was made to him of a mitre by John de Belemains,
prebendary of Chiswick. This appears, with other vestments for the
feast, in an inventory drawn up some twenty years later<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>. By
1263 abuses had grown up, and the chapter passed a statute to reform
them<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>. They required the election of the <i>praesul</i> and
his chapter and the drawing up of the <i>tabula</i> to take place
in the chapter-house instead of in the cathedral, on account of the
irreverence of the crowds pressing to see. The great dignitaries must
not be put down on the <i>tabula</i> for the servers’ functions, but
only the clergy of the second or third ‘form.’ The procession and all
the proceedings in the cathedral must be orderly and creditable to the
boys<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span> Minute directions follow as to the right of the ‘bishop’
to claim a supper on the eve from one of the canons, and as to the
train he may take with him, as well as for the dinner and supper of
the feast-day itself. After dinner a cavalcade is to start from the
cathedral for the blessing of the people. The dean must find a horse
for the ‘bishop,’ and each canon residentiary one for the lad who
personates him<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a>. Other statutes of earlier date make it incumbent
on a new residentiary to entertain his own boy-representative <i>cum
daunsa et chorea et torchiis</i> on Innocents’ day, and to sit up at
night for the ‘bishop’ and all his <i>cortège</i> on the octave. If
he is kept up very late, he may ‘cut’ Matins next morning<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>. The
Boy Bishop of St. Paul’s was accustomed to preach a sermon which,
not unnaturally, he did not write himself. William de Tolleshunte,
almoner of St. Paul’s in 1329, bequeathed to the almonry copies of
all the sermons preached by the Boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span> Bishops in his time. Probably he
was himself responsible for them<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a>. One such sermon was printed
by Wynkyn de Worde before 1500<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>. Another was written by Erasmus,
and exists both in Latin and English<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>. When Dean Colet drew up
the statutes of St. Paul’s School in 1512 he was careful to enact that
the scholars should attend the cathedral on Childermass day, hear the
sermon, and mass, and give a penny to the ‘bishop<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>.’</p>

<p>The earliest notice of the Boy Bishop at York, or for the matter of
that, in England, is in a statute (before 1221), which lays on him the
duty of finding rushes for the Nativity and Epiphany feasts<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>.
After this, there is nothing further until the second half of the
fourteenth century, when some interesting documents become available.
The chapter register for 1367 requires that in future the ‘bishop’
shall be the boy who has served longest and proved most useful in
the cathedral. A saving clause is added: <i>dum tamen competenter
sit corpore formosus</i><a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a>. This shows a sense of humour in the
chapter, for at York, as at Salisbury, <i>Corpore enim formosus es,
O fili</i> was a respond for the day. In 1390, was added a further
qualification that the ‘bishop’ must be a lad in good voice<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>.
Doubtless the office was much coveted, for it was a very remunerative
one. The visitation forbidden at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span> Salisbury by Roger de Mortival
was permitted at York, and the profits were considerable. Robert de
Holme, who was ‘bishop’ in 1369, received from the choirmaster, John
Gisson, who acted as his treasurer, no less a sum than £3 15<i>s.</i>
1¹⁄₂<i>d.</i><a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> In 1396 the amount was only £2 0<i>s.</i>
6¹⁄₂<i>d.</i> But this was only a small portion of the total receipts.
The complete <i>Computus</i> for this year happens to be preserved, and
shows that the Boy Bishop made a <i>quête</i> at intervals during the
weeks between Christmas and Candlemas, travelling with a ‘seneschal,’
four singers and a servant to such distant places as Bridlington,
Leeds, Beverley, Fountains abbey and Allerton. Their principal journey
lasted a fortnight. The oblations on Christmas and Innocents’ days
and the collection from the dignitaries in the cloister realized £2
15<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> In the city they got 10<i>s.</i> and abroad £5
10<i>s.</i> Out of this there were heavy expenses. The supper given
by the ‘bishop’ cost 15<i>s.</i> 6¹⁄₂<i>d.</i> Purchased meals had
to supplement hospitality at home and abroad. Horse hire and stable
expenses had to be met. There were the ‘bishop’s’ outfit, candles
to be borne in procession, fees to the minor cathedral officials,
gloves for presents to the vicars and schoolmasters. There was the
‘bishop’s’ own company to be rewarded for its services. The £2
0<i>s.</i> 6¹⁄₂<i>d.</i> represents the balance available for his
private use<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>. The most generous contributor to the <i>quête</i>
was the countess of Northumberland, who gave 20s. and a gold ring. This
is precisely the amount of the reward prescribed about 1522 for the
‘barne bishop’ of York, as well as for his brother of Beverley in the
<i>Household Book</i> of the fifth earl of Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>.</p>

<p>The printed service-books of the use of York do not deal as fully
with the Feast of Boys as do those of Sarum; but a manuscript missal
of the fifteenth century used in the cathedral itself contains some
additional rubrics with regard to the functions of the ‘bishop’ and
his ‘precentor’ at Mass<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a>. The names of some of the York ‘bishops’
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span> preserved, and show that the ceremony prevailed up to the
Reformation<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>. And this is confirmed by a list of ornaments for the
‘bishop’ in a sixteenth-century inventory<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a>.</p>

<p>I am unable to give such full data for Lincoln as for the cathedrals
already named; but regulations of 1300 and 1527 provide for the
supply of candles to the ‘bishop’ and the rest of the choir at
Vespers on the eve and matins on the day of the Innocents<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a>, and
an inventory of 1536 mentions a cope for the ‘barne busshop’ with a
moral ‘scriptur’ embroidered on it<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a>. Nor can I hope to supply any
exhaustive list of localities where the Boy Bishop flourished. These
include minor cathedrals such as Hereford<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>, Lichfield<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>,
Gloucester<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a>, and Norwich<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>, great collegiate churches such
as Beverley minster<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>, St. Peter’s, Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>,
    and Ottery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
St. Mary’s<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>, college chapels such as Magdalen<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> and All
Souls<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>, at Oxford, the private chapels of the king<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> and
the earl of Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>, and many parish churches both in
London<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>, and throughout the length and breadth of England<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>
and Scotland<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Unlike the Feast of Fools, the Feast of Boys enjoyed
a considerable vogue in religious houses. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span> John Peckham,
archbishop of Canterbury, was drawing up his constitutions for such
communities in 1279, he found it necessary to limit the duration of
this feast to the eve and day of the Holy Innocents<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a>. Traces of
the Boy Bishop are to be found in the archives of more than one great
monastery. A Westminster inventory of 1388 gives minute descriptions
of vestments and ornaments for his use, many of which appear to have
been quite recently provided by the ‘westerer’ or <i>vestiarius</i>,
Richard Tonworthe<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>. There was a mitre with silvered and gilt
plates and gems, and the inscription <i>Sancte Nicholae ora pro
nobis</i> set in pearls. There was a <i>baculus</i> with images of
St. Peter and St. Edward the Confessor upon thrones. There were two
pair of cheveril gloves, to match the mitre. There were an amice, a
rochet and a surplice. There were two albs and a cope of blood colour
worked with gryphons and other beasts and cisterns spouting water.
There was another ‘principal’ cope of ruby and blood-coloured velvet
embroidered in gold, and with the ‘new arms of England’ woven into
it. An older mitre and pair of gloves and a ring had been laid aside
as old-fashioned or worn out. Evidently the feast was celebrated with
some splendour. Several of the vestments are again inventoried in
1540<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>. A payment for the feast is recorded in a <i>Computus</i>
of 1413-14<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>. The accounts of the obedientiaries of Durham priory
show from 1369 onwards many payments by nearly all these officers to a
Boy Bishop of the almonry. He also received a gift up to 1528 from the
dependent house or ‘cell’ of Finchale priory. This payment was made
at the office of the <i>feretrarius</i> or keeper of Saint Cuthbert’s
shrine. The ‘bishop’ is called <i>episcopus puerilis</i>, <i>episcopus
eleemosynariae</i>, or the like. In 1405 he was not elected, <i>propter
guerras eo tempore</i>. In 1423 and 1434 there was also an <i>episcopus
de Elvett</i> or Elvetham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span> a manor of the priory<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>. The abbey of
Bury St. Edmunds had its <i>episcopus sancti Nicolai</i> in 1418 and
for at least a century longer<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>. At Winchester each of the great
monasteries held a Feast of Boys; the abbey of Hyde on St. Nicholas’
day<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a>; the priory of St. Swithin’s on that of the Holy Innocents.
Here, too, the accounts of the obedientiaries contain evidence of the
feast in payments between 1312 and 1536 for beer or wine sent to the
<i>episcopus iuvenum</i>. Nearly all the officers whose rolls are
preserved, the chamberlain, the curtarian, the cellarian, the almoner,
the sacristan, the <i>custos operum</i>, the hordarian, seem to have
contributed<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a>. A <i>Computus</i> of 1441 contains a payment to
the <i>pueri eleemosynariae</i> who, with the <i>pueri</i> of St.
Elizabeth’s chapel, visited St. Mary’s convent, dressed as girls,
and danced, sang and sported before the abbess and the nuns<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>.
We have had some French instances in which the Boy Bishop visited
a neighbouring convent. But the nuns were not always dependent on
outside visitors for their revel. In some places they held their
own feast, with an ‘abbess’ instead of a ‘bishop.’ Archbishop John
Peckham, in addition to his general constitution already quoted,
issued a special mandate to Godstow nunnery, forbidding the office
and prayers to be said <i>per parvulas</i> on Innocents’ day<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>.
Three centuries later, in 1526, a visitation of Carrow nunnery by
Richard Nicke, bishop of Norwich, disclosed a custom of electing a
Christmas ‘abbess’ there, which the bishop condemned<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>. Continental
parallels to these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span> examples are available. An eighth-century case,
indeed, which is quoted by some writers, has probably been the
subject of a misinterpretation<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>. But the visitation-books of
Odo Rigaud, archbishop of Rouen (1248-69) record that he forbade
the <i>ludibria</i> of the younger nuns at the Christmas feasts
and the feast of St. Mary Magdalen in more than one convent of his
diocese. One of these was the convent of the Holy Trinity at Caen,
in which an ‘abbess’ was still chosen by the novices in 1423<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>.
All the monastic examples here quoted come from houses of the older
foundations. The <i>Statutes</i>, however, of the Observant Franciscans
made at Barcelona in 1401, expressly forbid the use of secular
garments or the loan of habits of the order for <i>ludi</i> on St.
Nicholas’ or Innocents’ days<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>; whence it may be inferred that the
irregularities provided against were not unknown.</p>

<p>Mediaeval education began with the song-school: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span> although the
universities and other great seats of learning came to be much more
than glorified choirs, they still retained certain traces of their
humble origin. Amongst these was the Boy Bishop. The students of Paris
regularly chose their Boy Bishops on St. Nicholas’ day. In 1275,
indeed, the Faculty of Arts forbade the torchlight processions which
took place on that day and on St. Catherine’s, the two great common
holidays of the clerks<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>. But in 1367 such processions were held
as of ancient custom, and it would appear that every little group of
students gathered together under the protection and in the house of a
master of arts considered itself entitled to choose a ‘bishop,’ and to
lead him in a rout through the streets. In that year the custom led to
a tragic brawl which came under the cognizance of the <i>Parlement</i>
of Paris<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>. The scholars of one Peter de Zippa, dwelling <i>in vico
Bucherie ultra Parvum Pontem</i>, had chosen as ‘bishop’ Bartholomew
Divitis of Ypres. On St. Nicholas’ eve, they were promenading, with
a torch but unarmed, to the houses of the rector of the Faculty and
others <i>causa solacii et iocosa</i>, when they met with the watch.
Peter de Zippa was with them, and the watch had a grudge against Peter.
On the previous St. Catherine’s day they had arrested him, but he had
been released by the <i>préfet</i>. They now attacked the procession
with drawn swords, and wounded Jacobus de Buissono in the leg. As the
scholars were remonstrating, up came Philippus de Villaribus, <i>miles
gueti</i>, and Bernardus Blondelli, his deputy, and cried ‘<i>Ad
mortem</i>’. The scholars fled home, but the watch made an attack on
the house. Peter de Zippa attempted to appease them from a window, and
was wounded four fingers from a mortal spot. As the watch were on the
point of breaking in, the scholars surrendered. The house was looted,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span> the inmates beaten. One lad was pitched out on his head and
driven into the Seine, out of which he was helped by a woman. Peter de
Zippa and twenty-four others were rolled in the mud and then carried
off to the <i>Châtelet</i>, where they were shut up in a dark and
malodorous cell. Worst of all, the ‘bishop’ had disappeared altogether.
It was believed that the watch had slain him, and flung the body
into the Seine. A complaint was brought before the <i>Parlement</i>,
and a commission of inquiry appointed. The watch declared that Peter
de Zippa was insubordinate to authority and, although warned, as a
foreigner, both in French and Latin<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>, that they were the king’s
men, persisted in hurling logs and stones out of his window, with
the result of knocking four teeth out of Peter Patou’s mouth, and
wounding the horse of Philip de Villaribus. This defence was apparently
thought unsatisfactory, and a further inquiry was held, with the aid
of torture. Finally the court condemned the offending watch to terms
of imprisonment and the payment of damages. They had also to offer a
humble apology, with bare head and bent knee, to the bishop of Paris,
the rector of the Faculty, Peter de Zippa, and the injured scholars,
in the cloister or the chapter-house of St. Mathurin’s. The case of
the alleged murder of the ‘bishop,’ Bartholomew Divitis, was not to be
prejudiced by this judgement, and Peter de Zippa was warned to be more
submissive to authority in future. The whole episode is an interesting
parallel to the famous ‘town and gown’ at Oxford on St. Scholastica’s
day, 1353<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>.</p>

<p>Provision is made for a Boy Bishop in the statutes of more than one
great English educational foundation. William of Wykeham ordained
in 1400 that one should be chosen at Winchester College, and at New
College, Oxford, and should recite the office at the Feast of the
Innocents<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>. Some notices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span> in the Winchester College accounts
during the fifteenth century show that he also presided at secular
revels. In 1462 he is called <i>Episcopus Nicholatensis</i>, and on St.
Nicholas’ day he paid a visit of ceremony to the warden, who presented
him, out of the college funds, with fourpence<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a>. The example of
William of Wykeham was followed, forty years later, in the statutes of
the royal foundations of Eton College and King’s College, Cambridge.
But there was one modification. These colleges were dedicated to the
Virgin and to St. Nicholas, and it was carefully laid down that the
performance of the <i>officium</i> by the ‘bishop’ was to be on St.
Nicholas’ day, ‘and by no means on that of the Innocents<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>.’ The
Eton ‘bishop’ is said by the Elizabethan schoolmaster Malim, who wrote
a <i>Consuetudinarium</i> of the college in 1561, to have been called
<i>episcopus Nihilensis</i>, and to have been chosen on St. Hugh’s day
(November 17). Probably <i>Nihilensis</i> is a scribal mistake for
<i>Nicholatensis</i><a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a>. The custom had been abolished before Malim
wrote, but was extant in 1507, for in that year the ‘bishop’s’ rochet
was mended<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a>. Some Eton historians have thought that the Boy Bishop
ceremony was the origin of the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span> ‘Montem’; but as the ‘Montem’
was held on the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (January 25), and
as Malim mentions both customs independently, this is improbable<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a>.</p>

<p>Smaller schools than Winchester or Eton had none the less their Boy
Bishops. Archbishop Rotherham, who founded in 1481 a college at his
native place of Rotherham in Yorkshire, left by will in 1500 a mitre
for the ‘barnebishop<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>.’ The grammar school at Canterbury had, or
should have had, its Boy Bishop in 1464<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>. Aberdeen was a city of
which St. Nicholas was the patron, and at Aberdeen the master of the
grammar school was paid by a collection taken when he went the rounds
with the ‘bishop’ on St. Nicholas’ day<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>. Dean Colet, on the other
hand, when founding St. Paul’s school did not provide for a ‘bishop’
in the school itself, but, as we have seen, directed the scholars to
attend the mass and sermon of the ‘bishop’ in the cathedral.</p>

<p>Naturally the Reformation made war on the Boy Bishop. A royal
proclamation of July 22, 1541, forbade the ‘gatherings’ by children
‘decked and apparalid to counterfaite priestes, bysshopps, and women’
on ‘sainte Nicolas, sainte Catheryne, sainte Clement, the holye
Innocentes, and such like,’ and also the singing of mass and preaching
by boys on these days<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>. Naturally also, during the Marian reaction
the Boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span> Bishop reappeared. On November 13, 1554, Bishop Bonner issued
an order permitting all clerks in the diocese of London to have St.
Nicholas and to go abroad; and although this order was annulled on
the very eve of the festival, apparently because Cardinal Pole had
appointed St. Nicholas’ day for a great ceremony of reconciliation
at Lambeth, yet the custom was actually revived in several London
parishes, including St. Andrew’s, Holborn, and St. Nicholas Olave,
Bread Street<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>.
    In 1556 it was still more widely observed<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
But upon the accession of Elizabeth it naturally fell again into
disuse, and it has left few, if any, traces in modern folk-custom<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a>.</p>

<p>I need not, after the last two chapters, attempt an elaborate analysis
of the customs connected with the Boy Bishop. In the main they are
parallel to those of the Feast of Fools. They include the burlesque
of divine service, the <i>quête</i>, the banquet, the <i>dominus
festi</i>. Like the Feast of Fools, they probably contain a folk as
well as an ecclesiastical element. But the former is chastened and
subdued, the strength of ecclesiastical discipline having proved
sufficient, in the case of the boys, to bar for the most part such
excesses as the adult clerks inherited from the pagan Kalends. On one
point, however, a little more must be said. The <i>dominus festi</i>,
who at the Feast of Fools bears various names, is almost invariably
at the Feast of Boys a ‘bishop<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a>.’ This term must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
familiar by the end of the eleventh century for it lends a point
of sarcasm to the protest made by Yves, bishop of Chartres, in a
letter to Pope Urban II against the disgraceful nomination by Philip
I of France of a wanton lad to be bishop of Orleans in 1099<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>.
In later documents it appears in various forms, <i>episcopus
puerorum</i>, <i>episcopellus</i><a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>, <i>episcopus puerilis</i>
or <i>parvulus</i>, ‘boy bishop,’ ‘child bishop,’ ‘barne bishop.’ In
some English monasteries it is <i>episcopus eleemosynariae</i> (‘of
the almonry’); in Germany, <i>Schul-Bischof</i>, or, derisively,
<i>Apfeln-Bischof</i>. More significant than any of these is the common
variant <i>episcopus Nicholatensis</i>, ‘Nicholas bishop.’ For St.
Nicholas’ day (December 6) was hardly less important in the career of
the Boy Bishop than that of the Holy Innocents itself. At this feast he
was generally chosen and began his <i>quête</i> through the streets.
In more than one locality, Mainz for instance in Germany, Eton in
England, it was on this day as well as, or in substitution for, that
of the Innocents that he made his appearance in divine service<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a>.
St. Nicholas was, of course, the patron saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span> of schoolboys and of
children generally<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>. His prominence in the winter processions
of Germany and the presents which in modern folk-belief he brings
to children have been touched upon in an earlier chapter. It now
appears that originally he took rather than gave presents, and that
where he appeared in person he was represented by the Boy Bishop.
And this suggests the possibility that it was this connexion with
St. Nicholas, and not the profane mummings of Michael the Drunkard
at Constantinople, which led to the use of the term ‘bishop’ for the
<i>dominus festi</i>, first at the Feast of Boys, and ultimately at
the other Christmas feasts as well. For St. Nicholas was not only the
boys’ saint <i>par excellence</i>; he was also, owing to the legend
of his divinely ordered consecration when only a layman as bishop of
Myra, the bishop saint <i>par excellence</i><a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a>. However this may
be, I think it is a fair guess that St. Nicholas’ day was an older
date for a Feast of Boys than that of the Holy Innocents, and that the
double date records an instance of the process, generally imperfect, by
which, under Roman and Christian influence, the beginning of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span> winter
customs of the Germano-Keltic peoples were gradually transformed into
mid-winter customs<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>. The beginning of winter feast was largely a
domestic feast, and the children probably had a special part in it. It
is possible also to trace a survival of the corresponding beginning
of summer feast in the day of St. Gregory on March 12, which was also
sometimes marked by the election of a <i>Schul-Bischof</i><a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a>.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>—The best account of the
<i>Sociétés joyeuses</i> is that of L. Petit de Julleville,
<i>Les Comédiens en France au Moyen Âge</i> (1889). Much material
is collected in the same writer’s <i>Répertoire du Théâtre
comique en France au Moyen Âge</i> (1886), and in several of the
books given as authorities on the Feast of Fools (ch. xiii),
especially those of Du Tilliot, Rigollot, Leber, and Grenier.
Mme. Clément (née Hémery), <i>Histoire des Fêtes civiles et
religieuses du Département du Nord</i> (1832), may also be
consulted. M. Petit de Julleville’s account of the <i>Sottie</i>
is supplemented by E. Picot, <i>La Sottie en France</i>, in
<i>Romania</i>, vol. vii, and there is a good study of the
fool-literature of the Renascence in C. H. Herford, <i>Literary
Relations between England and Germany in the Sixteenth
Century</i> (1886). Amongst writers on the court fool are J. F.
Dreux du Radier, <i>Histoire des Fous en Titre d’Office</i>,
in <i>Récréations historiques</i> (1768); C. F. Flögel,
<i>Geschichte der Hofnarren</i> (1789); F. Douce, <i>Clowns and
Fools of Shakespeare</i> in <i>Variorum Shakespeare</i> (1821),
xxi. 420, and <i>Illustrations of Shakespeare</i> (1839); C.
Leber in Rigollot, xl; J. Doran, <i>History of Court Fools</i>
(1858); A. F. Nick, <i>Hof-und Volksnarren</i> (1861); P. Lacroix
(le bibliophile Jacob), <i>Dissertation sur les Fous des Rois
de France</i>; A. Canel, <i>Recherches historiques sur les Fous
des Rois de France</i> (1873); A. Gazeau, <i>Les Bouffons</i>
(1882); P. Moreau, <i>Fous et Bouffons</i> (1885). Much of this
literature fails to distinguish between the <i>stultus</i> and

Shakesperianae</i> (1887).]</p>

<p>The conclusion of this volume must call attention to certain traces
left by the ecclesiastical <i>ludi</i> of the New Year, themselves
extinct, upon festival custom, and, through this, upon dramatic
tradition. The Feast of Fools did not altogether vanish with its
suppression in the cathedrals. It had had its origin in the popular
celebration of the Kalends. Throughout it did not altogether lack a
popular element. The <i>bourgeois</i> crowded into the cathedral to see
and share in the revel. The Fool Bishop in his turn left the precincts
and made his progress through the city streets, while his satellites
played their pranks abroad for the entertainment of the mob. The
feast was a dash of colour in the civic as well as the ecclesiastical
year. The Tournai riots of 1499 show that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span> <i>jeunesse</i> of
that city had come to look upon it as a <i>spectacle</i> which they
were entitled to claim from the cathedral. What happened in Tournai
doubtless happened elsewhere. And the upshot of it was that when in
chapter after chapter the reforming party got the upper hand and the
official celebration was dropped, the city and its <i>jeunesse</i>
themselves stepped into the breach and took measures to perpetuate the
threatened delightful dynasty. It was an easy way to avert the loss
of a holiday. And so we find a second tradition of Feasts of Fools,
in which the <i>fous</i> are no longer vicars but <i>bourgeois</i>,
and the <i>dominus festi</i> is a popular ‘king’ or ‘prince’ rather
than a clerical ‘bishop.’ A mid-fifteenth-century writer, Martin
Franc, attests the vogue of the <i>prince des folz</i> in the towns of
northern France:</p>

<p>The term <i>Roi</i> or <i>Prince des Sots</i> is perhaps the most
common one for the new <i>dominus festi</i>, and, like <i>sots</i> or
<i>folz</i> themselves, is generic. But there are many local variants,
as the <i>Prévôt des Étourdis</i> at Bouchain<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a>, the <i>Roi des
Braies</i> at Laon, the <i>Roi de l’Epinette</i> at Lille, and the
<i>Prince de la Jeunesse</i> at St. Quentin<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a>. The <i>dominus
festi</i> was as a rule chosen by one or more local guilds or
<i>confréries</i> into which the <i>jeunesse</i> were organized for
the purpose of maintaining the feast. The fifteenth century was an age
of guilds in every department of social life, and the <i>compagnies
des fous</i> or <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> are but the frivolous
counterparts of religious <i>confréries</i> or literary <i>puys</i>.
The most famous of all such <i>sociétés</i>, that of <i>l’Infanterie
Dijonnaise</i> at Dijon, seems directly traceable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span> to the fall of
an ecclesiastical Feast of Fools. Such a feast was held, as we have
seen, in the ducal, afterwards royal, chapel, and was abolished by the
<i>Parlement</i> of Dijon in 1552. Before this date nothing is heard of
<i>l’Infanterie</i>. A quarter of a century later it is in full swing,
and the character of its dignitaries and its badges point clearly to
a derivation from the chapel feast<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a>. The Dijon example is but a
late one of a development which had long taken place in many parts of
northern France and Flanders. It would be difficult to assert that a
<i>société joyeuse</i> never made its appearance in any town before the
ecclesiastical Feast of Fools had died out therein. Occasionally the
two institutions overlap<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a>. But, roughly speaking, the one is the
inheritor of the other; ‘<i>La confrérie des sots, c’est la Fête des
Fous sécularisée</i><a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>.’ Amongst the chief of these <i>sociétés</i>
are the <i>Enfants-sans-Souci</i> of Paris, the <i>Cornards</i> or
<i>Connards</i> of Rouen and Evreux<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>, the <i>Suppôts du Seigneur
de la Coquille</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span> of Lyons<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a>. The history of these has been
written excellently well by M. Petit de Julleville, and I do not
propose to repeat it. A few general points, however, deserve attention.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical Feast of Fools flourished rather in cathedrals than
in monasteries. The <i>sociétés</i> however, like some more serious
<i>confréries</i><a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>, seem to have preferred a conventual to a
capitular model for their organization<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>. The <i>Cornards</i>,
both at Rouen and Evreux, were under an <i>Abbé</i>. Cambrai had its
<i>Abbaye joyeuse de Lescache-Profit</i>, Chalons-sur-Saône its <i>Abbé
de la Grande Abbaye</i>, Arras its <i>Abbé de Liesse</i>, Poitiers
its <i>Abbé de Mau Gouverne</i><a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>. The literary adaptation of
this idea by Rabelais in the <i>Abbaye de Thélème</i> is familiar.
This term <i>abbaye</i> is common to the <i>sociétés</i>, with some
at least of the <i>Basoches</i> or associations of law-clerks to
the <i>Parlements</i> of Paris and the greater provincial towns.
The <i>Basoches</i> existed for mutual protection, but for mutual
amusement also, and on one side at least of their activity they
were much of the nature of <i>sociétés joyeuses</i><a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a>. At
Rheims in 1490 a <i>Basoche</i> entered into rivalry of dramatic
invective with the celebrants of the ecclesiastical Feast of
Fools<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>. The <i>Basoche</i> of Paris was in the closest relations
to, if not actually identical with, the <i>société</i> of the
<i>Enfants-sans-Souci</i><a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>. Just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span> the law-clerks of Paris were
banded together in their <i>Basoche</i>, so were the students of Paris
in their ‘university,’ ‘faculties,’ ‘nations,’ and other groups; and
in 1470, long after the regular Feast of Fools had disappeared from
the city, the students were still wont to put on the fool habit and
elect their <i>rex fatuorum</i> on Twelfth night<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a>. Yet other
guilds of a more serious character, generally speaking, than the
<i>sociétés joyeuses</i>, none the less occasionally gave themselves
over to <i>joyeuseté</i>. The <i>Deposuit</i> brought rebuke upon
religious <i>confréries</i> up to a quite late date<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a>; and traces
of the <i>fous</i> are to be found amongst the recreations of no
less a body than the famous and highly literary <i>puy</i> of Arras.
The <i>sociétés joyeuses</i>, like the <i>puys</i>, were primarily
associations of amateur, rather than professional merry-makers, a fact
which distinguishes them from the corporations of minstrels described
in a previous chapter<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>. But minstrels and <i>trouvères</i> were
by no means excluded. The poet Gringoire was <i>Mère-Sotte</i> of the
Paris <i>Enfants-sans-Souci</i>. Clément Marot was a member of the
same body. In the <i>puy</i> of Arras the minstrels traditionally
held an important place; and as the literary and dramatic side of
the <i>sociétés</i> grew, it is evident that the men who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
professionally ready with their pens must everywhere have been in
demand.</p>

<p>The primary function of the <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> and their
congeners was the celebration of the traditional Feast of Fools at or
about the New Year. In Paris, Twelfth night was a day of festival for
the <i>Basoche</i> as well as for the minor association of exchequer
clerks known as the <i>Empire de Galilée</i>. In mid-January came the
<i>fête des Braies</i> at Laon, and the <i>fête</i> of the <i>Abbaye
de Lescache-Profit</i> at Cambrai. That of the <i>Prince des Sots</i>
at Amiens was on the first of January itself<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a>. On the same day
three <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> united in a <i>fête de l’âne</i> at
Douai<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>. But January was no clement month for the elaborated revels
of increasingly luxurious burghers; and it is not surprising to find
that many of the <i>sociétés</i> transferred their attention to other
popular feasts which happened to fall at more genial seasons of the
year. To the celebration of these, the spring feast of the carnival or
Shrovetide, the summer feasts of May-day or Midsummer, they brought all
the wantonness of the Feast of Fools. The <i>Infanterie Dijonnaise</i>,
the <i>Cornards</i> of Rouen and Evreux, the third Parisian law
association, that of the <i>Châtelet</i>, especially cultivated the
carnival. The three obligatory feasts of the <i>Basoche</i> included,
besides that of Twelfth night, one on May-day and one at the beginning
of July<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a>. On May-day, too, a guild in the parish of St. Germain at
Amiens held its <i>fête des fous</i><a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a>. It may be noted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span> these
summer extensions of the reign of folly are not without parallels of a
strictly ecclesiastical type. At Châlons-sur-Marne, as late as 1648, a
chapter procession went to the woods on St. John’s eve to cut boughs
for the decking of the church<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>. At Evreux a similar custom grew
into a very famous revel<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>. This was the <i>procession noire</i>,
otherwise known as the <i>cérémonie de la Saint-Vital</i>, because
the proceedings began on the day of St. Vitalis (April 28) and lasted
to the second Vespers on May 1. Originally the canons, afterwards the
choir-clerks, chaplains, and vicars, went at day-break on May morning
to gather branches in the bishop’s woods. Their return was the signal
for riotous proceedings. The bells were violently rung. Masks were
worn. Bran was thrown in the eyes of passers-by, and they were made
to leap over broomsticks. The choir-clerks took the high stalls,
and the choir-boys recited the office. In the intervals the canons
played at skittles over the vaults; there were dancing and singing
and the rest, ‘as at the time of the Nativity<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a>.’ The abuses of
this festival must have begun at an early date, for two canons of the
cathedral, one of whom died in 1206, are recorded to have been hung out
of the belfry windows in a vain attempt to stop the bell-ringing. Its
extension to St. Vitalis’ day is ascribed to another canon, singularly
named Bouteille, who is said to have founded about 1270 a very odd
<i>obit</i>. He desired that a pall should lie on the pavement of the
choir, and that on each corner and in the middle of this should stand
a bottle of wine, to be drunk by the singing-men. The canon Bouteille
may be legendary, but the wine-bottle figured largely in the festival
ceremonies. While the branches were distributed in the bishop’s wood,
which came to be known as the <i>bois de la Bouteille</i>, the company
drank and ate cakes. Two bottle-shaped holes were dug in the earth and
filled with sand. On the day of the <i>obit</i> an enormous leather
bottle, painted with marmosets, serpents, and other grotesques, was
placed in the choir. These rites were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span> extant at Evreux in 1462,
when a fresh attempt to suppress the bell-jangling led to a fresh
riot. No explanation is given of the term <i>procession noire</i> as
used at Evreux, but a Vienne parallel suggests that, as in some other
seasonal festivals, those who took part in the procession had their
faces blacked. At Vienne, early on May 1, four men, naked and black,
started from the archbishop’s palace and paraded the city. They were
chosen respectively by the archbishop, the cathedral chapter, and
the abbots of St. Peter’s and St. John’s. Subsequently they formed a
<i>cortège</i> for a <i>rex</i>, also chosen by the archbishop, and a
<i>regina</i> from the convent of St. Andrew’s. A St. Paul, from the
hospital dedicated to that saint, also joined in the procession, and
carried a cup of ashes which he sprinkled in the faces of those he met.
This custom lasted to the seventeenth century<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a>.</p>

<p>But the seasonal feasts did not exhaust the activities of the
<i>sociétés</i>. Occasional events, a national triumph, a royal
entry, not to speak of local <i>faits divers</i>, found them ready
with appropriate celebrations<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>. The <i>Infanterie Dijonnaise</i>
made a solemn function of the admission of new members<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>.
And more than one <i>société</i> picked up from folk-custom the
tradition of the <i>charivari</i>, constituting itself thus the
somewhat arbitrary guardian of burgess morality<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>. M. Petit de
Julleville analyses a curious <i>jeu</i> filled with chaff against an
unfortunate M. Du Tillet who underwent the penalty at Dijon in 1579
for the crime of beating his wife in the month of May<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a>. At Lyon,
too, <i>chevauchées</i> of a similar type seem to have been much in
vogue<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a>.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the entertainment of the
<i>sociétés joyeuses</i> was largely dramatic. We find them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span> as
indeed we find the participants in the strictly clerical feasts of
Fools<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> and of Boys<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a>, during the same period, occupied
with the performance both of miracles and of the various forms of
contemporary comedy known as farces, moralities, <i>sotties</i> and
<i>sermons joyeux</i><a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a>. Of their share in the miracles the next
volume may speak<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>: their relations to the development of comedy
require a word or two here. That normal fifteenth-century comedy,
that of the farce and the morality, in any way had its origin in the
Feast of Fools, whether clerical or lay, can hardly be admitted.
It almost certainly arose out of the minstrel tradition, and when
already a full-blown art was adapted by the <i>fous</i>, as by other
groups of amateur performers, from minstrelsy. With the special forms
of the <i>sottie</i> and the <i>sermon joyeux</i> it is otherwise.
These may reasonably be regarded as the definite contribution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span> the
Feast of Fools to the types of comedy. The very name of the <i>sermon
joyeux</i>, indeed, sufficiently declares its derivation. It is parody
of a class, the humour of which would particularly appeal to revelling
clerks: it finds its place in the general burlesque of divine worship,
which is the special note of the feast<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>. The character of the
<i>sotties</i>, again, does not leave their origin doubtful; they are,
on the face of them, farces in which the actors are <i>sots</i> or
<i>fous</i>. Historically, we know that some at least of the extant
<i>sotties</i> were played by <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> at Paris, Geneva
and elsewhere; and the analysis of their contents lays bare the ruling
idea as precisely that expressed in the motto of the <i>Infanterie
Dijonnaise</i>—‘<i>Stultorum numerus est infinitus</i>.’ It is their
humour and their mode of satire to represent the whole world, from king
to clown, as wearing the cap and bells, and obeying the lordship of
folly. French writers have aptly compared them to the modern dramatic
type known as the <i>revue</i><a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a>. The germ of the <i>sottie</i>
is to be found as early as the thirteenth century in the work of that
Adan de la Hale, whose anticipation of at least one other form of
fifteenth-century drama has called for comment<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a>. Adan’s <i>Jeu
de la Feuillée</i> seems to have been played before the <i>puy</i>
of Arras, perhaps, as the name suggests, in the <i>tonnelle</i> of a
garden, on the eve of the first of May, 1262. It is composed of various
elements: the later scenes are a <i>féerie</i> in which the author
draws upon Hellequin and his <i>mesnie</i> and the three <i>fées</i>,
Morgue, Maglore and Arsile, of peasant tradition. But there is an
episode which is sheer <i>sottie</i>. The relics of St. Acaire,
warranted to cure folly, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span> tried upon the good burgesses of Arras
one by one; and there is a genuine fool or <i>dervés</i>, who, like his
lineal descendant Touchstone, ‘uses his folly as a stalking-horse to
shoot his wit’ in showers of arrowy satire upon mankind<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a>. Of the
later and regular <i>sotties</i>, the most famous are those written by
Pierre Gringoire for the <i>Enfants-sans-Souci</i> of Paris. In these,
notably the <i>Jeu du Prince des Sotz</i>, and in others by less famous
writers, the conception of the all-embracing reign of folly finds
constant and various expression<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a>. Outside France some reflection
of the <i>sottie</i> is to be found in the <i>Fastnachtspiele</i>
or Shrovetide plays of Nuremberg and other German towns. These were
performed mainly, but not invariably, at Shrovetide, by students or
artisans, not necessarily organized into regular guilds. They are
dramatically of the crudest, being little more than processions of
figures, each of whom in turn sings his couplets. But in several
examples these figures are a string of <i>Narren</i>, and the matter
of the verses is in the satirical vein of the <i>sotties</i><a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a>.
The <i>Fastnachtspiele</i> are probably to be traced, not so much to
the Feast of Fools proper, as to the spring sword-dances in which,
as we have seen, a <i>Narr</i> or ‘fool’ is <i>de rigueur</i>. They
share, however, with the <i>sotties</i> their fundamental idea of the
universal domination of folly.</p>

<p>The extension of this idea may indeed be traced somewhat widely in
the satirical and didactic literature of the later Middle Ages and
the Renascence. I cannot go at length into this question here, but
must content myself with referring to Professor Herford’s valuable
account of the cycle, which includes the <i>Speculum Stultorum</i>
of Wireker, Lydgate’s <i>Order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span> of Fools</i>, Sebastian Brandt’s
<i>Narrenschiff</i> and its innumerable imitations, the <i>Encomium
Moriae</i> of Erasmus, and Robert Armin the player’s <i>Nest of
Ninnies</i><a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a>.</p>

<p>Wireker was an Englishman, and the ‘Order’ founded in the
<i>Speculum</i> by Brunellus, the Ass, was clearly suggested by the
<i>sociétés joyeuses</i>. Traces of such <i>sociétés</i> in England
are, however, rare. Some of the titles of local lords of misrule, such
as the Abbot of Marrall at Shrewsbury or the Abbot of Bon-Accord at
Aberdeen, so closely resemble the French nomenclature as to suggest
their existence; but the only certain example I have come across is in
a very curious record from Exeter. The register of Bishop Grandisson
contains under the date July 11, 1348, a mandate to the archdeacon
and dean of Exeter and the rector of St. Paul’s, requiring them to
prohibit the proceedings of a certain ‘sect of malign men’ who call
themselves the ‘Order of Brothelyngham.’ These men, says the bishop,
wear a monkish habit, choose a lunatic fellow as abbot, set him up
in the theatre, blow horns, and for day after day beset in a great
company the streets and places of the city, capturing laity and
clergy, and exacting ransom from them ‘in lieu of a sacrifice.’ This
they call a <i>ludus</i>, but it is sheer rapine<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a>. Grandisson’s
learned editor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span> thinks that this <i>secta</i> was a sect of mediaeval
dissenters, but the description clearly points to a <i>société
joyeuse</i>. And the recognition of the <i>droits</i> exacted as being
<i>loco sacrificii</i> is to a folk-lorist most interesting.</p>

<p>More than one of the records which I have had occasion to quote make
mention of an <i>habit des fous</i> as of a recognized and familiar
type of dress. These records are not of the earliest. The celebrants of
the ecclesiastical Feast of Fools wore <i>larvae</i> or masks. Laity
and clergy exchanged costumes: and the wearing of women’s garments
by men probably represents one of the most primitive elements in
the custom. But there can be little doubt as to the nature of the
traditional ‘habit des fous’ from the fourteenth century onwards. Its
most characteristic feature was that hood garnished with ears, the
distribution of which to persons of importance gave such offence at
Tournai in 1499. A similar hood, fitting closely over the head and cut
in scollops upon the shoulders, reappears in the <i>bâton</i>, dated
1482, of the fools in the ducal chapel of Dijon. Besides two large
asses’ ears, it also bears a central peak or crest<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>. The eared
hood became the regular badge of the <i>sociétés joyeuses</i>. It is
found on most of the seals and other devices of the <i>Infanterie
Dijonnaise</i>, variously modified, and often with bells hung upon
the ears and the points of the scollops<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a>. It was used at
Amiens<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a>, and at Rouen and Evreux probably gave a name to the
<i>Cornards</i><a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a>. Marot describes it as appropriate to a <i>sot
de la Basoche</i> at Paris[1378]. It belongs also to the <i>Narren</i>
of Nuremberg<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a>, and is to be seen in innumerable figured
representations of fools in miniatures, woodcuts, carvings, the Amiens
<i>monetae</i>, and so forth, during the later Middle Ages and the
Renascence<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span> Such a close-fitting hood was of course common wear
in the fourteenth century. It is said to be of Gaulish origin, and to
be retained in the religious cowl. The <i>differentiae</i> of the hood
of a ‘fool’ from another must be sought in the grotesque appendages of
ears, crest and bells<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a>. Already an eared hood, exactly like that
of the ‘fools,’ distinguishes a mask, perhaps Gaulish, of the Roman
period<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a>. It may therefore have been adopted in the <i>Kalendae</i>
at an early date. But it is not, I think, unfair to assume that it was
originally a sophistication of a more primitive headdress, namely the
actual head of a sacrificial animal worn by the worshipper at the New
Year festival. That the ears are asses’ ears explains itself in view of
the prominence of that animal at the Feast of Fools. It must be added
that the central crest is developed in some of the examples figured
by Douce into the head and neck, in others into the comb only, of a
cock<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a>. With the hood, in most of the examples quoted above, goes
the <i>marotte</i>. This is a kind of doll carried by the ‘fool,’ and
presents a replica of his own head and shoulders with their hood upon
the end of a short staff. In some of Douce’s figures the <i>marotte</i>
is replaced or supplemented by some other form of bauble, such as
a bladder on a stick, stuffed into various shapes, or hollow and
containing peas<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>. Naturally the colours of the ‘fools’ were gay
and strikingly contrasted. Those of the Paris <i>Enfants-sans-Souci</i>
were yellow and green<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a>. But it may be doubted whether these
colours were invariable, or whether there is much in the symbolical
significance attributed to them by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span> certain writers<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>. The
<i>Infanterie Dijonnaise</i> in fact added red to their yellow and
green<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a>. The colours of the Clèves Order of Fools were red and
yellow<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a>.</p>

<p>It will not have escaped notice that the costume just described, the
parti-coloured garments, the hood with its ears, bells and coxcomb,
and the <i>marotte</i>, is precisely that assigned by the custom of
the stage to the fools who appear as <i>dramatis personae</i> in
several of Shakespeare’s plays<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>. Yet these fools have nothing
to do with <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> or the Feast of Fools; they
represent the ‘set,’ ‘allowed,’ or ‘all-licensed’ fool<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a>, the
domestic jester of royal courts and noble houses. The great have
always found pleasure in that near neighbourhood of folly which meaner
men vainly attempt to shun. Rome shared the <i>stultus</i> with her
eastern subjects and her barbarian invaders alike; and the ‘natural,’
genuine or assumed, was, like his fellow the dwarf, an institution
in every mediaeval and Renascence palace<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>. The question arises
how far the <i>habit</i> of the <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> was also
that of the domestic fool. In France there is some evidence that
from the end of the fourteenth century it was occasionally at least
taken as such. The tomb in Saint Maurice’s at Senlis of Thévenin de
St. Leger, fool to Charles V, who died in 1374, represents him in
a crested hood with a <i>marotte</i><a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a>. Rabelais describes the
fool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span> Seigni Joan, apparently intended for a court fool, as having
a <i>marotte</i> and ears to his hood. On the other hand, he makes
Panurge present Triboulet, the fool of Louis XII, with a sword of gilt
wood and a bladder<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>. A little later Jean Passerat speaks of the
hood, green and yellow, with bells, of another royal fool<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>. In
the seventeenth century the green and yellow and an eared hood formed
part of the fool’s dress which the duke of Nevers imposed upon a
peccant treasurer<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a>. But in France the influence of the <i>sociétés
joyeuses</i> was directly present. I do not find that the data quoted
by Douce quite bear out his transference of the regular French <i>habit
de fou</i> to England. Hoods were certainly required as part of the
costume for ‘fools,’ ‘disards,’ or ‘vices’ in the court revels of
1551-2, together with ‘longe’ coats of various gay colours<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a>;
but these were for masks, and on ordinary occasions the fools of the
king and the nobles seem to have worn the usual dress of a courtier
or servant<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a>. Like Triboulet, they often bore, as part of this,
a gilded wooden sword<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a>. A coxcomb, however, seems to have been
a recognized fool ensign<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a>, and once, in a tale, the complete
<i>habit</i> is described<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a>. Other fool costumes include a long
petticoat<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>,
    the more primitive calf-skin<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span> and a fox tail
hanging from the back<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>. The two latter seem to bring us back to
the sacrificial <i>exuviae</i>, and form a link between the court fool
and the grotesque ‘fool,’ or ‘Captain Cauf Tail’ of the morris dances
and other village revels.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the case with the domestic fool of history, it
is not improbable that the tradition of the stage rightly interprets
the intention of Shakespeare. The actual texts are not very decisive.
The point that is most clear is that the fool wears a ‘motley’ or
‘patched’ coat<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>. The fool in <i>Lear</i> has a ‘coxcomb<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a>’;
Monsieur Lavache in <i>All’s Well</i> a ‘bauble,’ not of course
necessarily a <i>marotte</i><a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>; Touchstone, in <i>As You Like
It</i>, is a courtier and has a sword<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>. The sword may perhaps
be inherited from the ‘vice’ of the later moralities<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a>; and, in
other respects, it is possible that Shakespeare took his conception
of the fool less from contemporary custom, for indeed we hear of no
fool at Elizabeth’s court, than from the abundant fool-literature,
continental and English, above described. The earliest of his fools,
Feste in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, quotes Rabelais, in whose work, as we
have just seen, the fool Triboulet figures<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>. It is noticeable that
the appearance of fools as important <i>dramatis personae</i> in the
plays apparently coincides with the substitution for William Kempe as
‘comic lead’ in the Lord Chamberlain’s company of Robert Armin<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a>,
whose own <i>Nest of Ninnies</i> abounds in reminiscences of the
fool-literature<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a>. But whatever outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span> appearance Shakespeare
intended his fools to bear, there can be no doubt that in their
dramatic use as vehicles of general social satire they very closely
recall the manner of the <i>sotties</i>. Touchstone is the type: ‘He
uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of
that he shoots his wit<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a>.’</p>

<p>Already in Saxon England Christmas was becoming a season of secular
merry-making as well as of religious devotion<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a>. Under the
post-Conquest kings this tendency was stimulated by the fixed habit
of the court. William the Bastard, like Charlemagne before him, chose
the solemn day for his coronation; and from his reign Christmas
takes rank, with Easter, Whitsuntide, and, at a much later date, St.
George’s day, as one of the great courtly festivals of the year. The
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> is at the pains to record the place of
its celebration, twelvemonth after twelvemonth<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>. Among the many
forgotten Christmassings of mediaeval kings, history lays a finger on
a few of special note: that at which Richard II, with characteristic
extravagance and the consumption of ‘200 tunns of wine and 2,000 oxen
with their appurtenances,’ entertained the papal legate in 1398;
and that, more truly royal, at which Henry V, besieging Rouen in
1418,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span> ‘refreshed all the poore people with vittels to their great
comfort and his high praise<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a>.’ The Tudors were not behindhand
with any opportunity for pageantry and display, nor does the vogue of
Christmas throughout the length and breadth of ‘merrie England’ need
demonstration<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a>. The Puritans girded at it, as they did at May
games, and the rest of the delightful circumstance of life, until in
1644 an ordinance of the Long Parliament required the festival to give
place to a monthly fast with the day fixed for which it happened to
coincide<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a>.</p>

<p>The entertainment of a mediaeval Christmas was diverse. There was the
banquet. The Boy Bishop came to court. Carols were sung. New Year
gifts were exchanged. <i>Hastiludia</i>—jousts or tournaments—were
popular and splendid. Minstrels and jugglers made music and mirth.
A succession of gaieties filled the Twelve nights from the Nativity
to the Epiphany, or even the wider space from St. Thomas’s day to
Candlemas. It is, however, in the custom of masquing that I find the
most direct legacy to Christmas of the Kalends celebrations in their
<i>bourgeois</i> forms. <i>Larvae</i> or masks are prominent in the
records and prohibitions of the Feast of Fools from the decretal
of Innocent III in 1207 to the letter of the Paris theologians in
1445<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a>. I take them as being, like the characteristic hood of the
‘fool,’ sophistications of the <i>capita pecudum</i>, the sacrificial
<i>exuviae</i> worn by the rout of worshippers at the <i>Kalendae</i>.
Precisely such <i>larvae</i>, under another name, confront us in the
detailed records of two fourteenth-century Christmasses. Amongst
the documents of the Royal Wardrobe for the reign of Edward III are
lists of stuffs issued for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span> the <i>ludi domini regis</i> in 1347-8
and 1348-9<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a>. For the Christmas of 1347, held at Guildford, were
required a number of ‘viseres’ in the likeness of men, women, and
angels, curiously designed ‘crestes,’ and other costumes representing
dragons, peacocks, and swans<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>. The Christmas of 1348 held
at Ottford and the following Epiphany at Merton yield similar
entries<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a>. What were these ‘viseres’ used for? The term <i>ludi</i>
must not be pressed. It appears to be distinct from <i>hastiludia</i>,
which comes frequently in the same documents, although in the
<i>hastiludia</i> also ‘viseres’ were used<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span> does not
necessarily imply anything dramatic, and the analogies suggest that it
is a wide generic term, roughly equivalent to ‘disports,’ or to the
‘revels’ of the Tudor vocabulary<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a>. It recurs in 1388 when the
Wardrobe provided linen coifs for twenty-one counterfeit men of the law
in the <i>ludus regis</i><a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a>. The sets of costumes supplied for all
these <i>ludi</i> would most naturally be used by groups of performers
in something of the nature of a dance; and they point to some
primitive form of masque, such as Froissart describes in contemporary
France<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a>, the precursor of the long line of development which,
traceable from the end of the following century, culminates in the
glories of Ben Jonson. The vernacular name for such a <i>ludus</i> in
the fourteenth century was ‘mumming’ or ‘disguising<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a>.’ Orders of
the city of London in 1334, 1393, and 1405 forbid a practice of going
about the streets at Christmas <i>ove visere ne faux visage</i>, and
entering the houses of citizens to play at dice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span> therein<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a>. In 1417
‘mummyng’ is specifically included in a similar prohibition<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>;
and in a proclamation of the following year, ‘mommyng’ is classed
with ‘playes’ and ‘enterludes’ as a variety of ‘disgisyng<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a>.’
But the disport which they denied to less dignified folk the rulers
of the city retained for themselves as the traditional way of paying
a visit of compliment to a great personage. A fragmentary chronicle
amongst Stowe’s manuscripts describes such a visit paid to Richard II
at the Candlemas preceding his accession in 1377. The ‘mummers’ were
disguised with ‘vizards’ to represent an emperor and a pope with their
<i>cortèges</i>. They rode to Kennington, entered the hall on foot,
invited the prince and the lords to dice and discreetly lost, drank
and danced with the company, and so departed<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>. This is the first
of several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span> such mummings upon record. Some chroniclers relate that it
was at a mumming that the partisans of Richard II attempted to seize
Henry IV on Twelfth night in 1400<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a>. In the following year, when
the Emperor Manuel of Constantinople spent Christmas with Henry at
Eltham, the ‘men of London maden a gret mommyng to hym of xij aldermen
and there sons, for whiche they hadde gret thanke<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a>.’ In 1414 Sir
John Oldcastle and his Lollards were in their turn accused of using
a mumming as a cloak of sedition<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a>. Thus the London distrust of
false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span> visages had its justification, and it is noteworthy that so late
as 1511 an Act of Parliament forbade the visits of mummers disguised
with visors to great houses on account of the disorders so caused. Even
the sale of visors was made illegal<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>.</p>

<p>So far there is nothing to point to the use of any dialogue or speeches
at mummings. The only detailed account is that of 1377, and the
passage which describes how the mummers ‘saluted’ the lords, ‘shewing
a pair of dice upon a table to play with the prince,’ reads rather
as if the whole performance were in dumb show. This is confirmed
by the explanation of the term ‘mummynge’ given in a contemporary
glossary<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a>. The development of the mumming in a literary direction
may very likely have been due to the multifarious activity of John
Lydgate. Amongst his miscellaneous poems are preserved several which
are stated by their collector Shirley to have been written for mummings
or disguisings either before the king or before the lord mayor of
London<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>. They all seem to belong to the reign of Henry VI and
probably to the years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span> 1427-30. And they show pretty clearly the way
in which verses got into the disguisings. Two of them are ‘lettres’
introducing mummings presented by the guilds of the mercers and the
goldsmiths to lord mayor Eastfield<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a>. They were doubtless read
aloud in the hall. A <i>balade</i> sent to Henry and the queen mother
at Eltham is of the same type<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a>. Two ‘devyses’ for mummings at
London and Windsor were probably recited by a ‘presenter.’ The Windsor
one is of the nature of a prologue, describing a ‘myracle’ which the
king is ‘to see<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>.’ The London one was meant to accompany the
course of the performance, and describes the various personages as they
enter<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a>. Still more elaborate is a set of verses used at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span> Hertford.
The first part of these is certainly spoken by a presenter who points
out the ‘vpplandishe’ complainants to whom he refers. But the reply is
in the first person, and apparently put in the mouths of the ‘wyues’
themselves, while the conclusion is a judgement delivered, again
probably by the presenter, in the name of the king<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>.</p>

<p>Whether Lydgate was the author of an innovation or not, the
introduction of speeches, songs, and dialogues was common enough in
the fully-developed mummings. For these we must look to the sumptuous
courts of the early Tudors. Lydgate died about 1451, and the Wars of
the Roses did not encourage revelry. The <i>Paston Letters</i> tell how
the Lady Morley forbade ‘dysguysyngs’ in her house at Christmas after
her husband’s death in 1476<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a>. There were <i>ludi</i> in Scotland
under James III<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a>. But those of his successor, James IV, although
numerous and varied<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a>, probably paled before the elaborate ‘plays’
and ‘disguisings’ which the contemporary account-books of Henry VII
reveal<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>. Of only one ‘disguising,’ however, of this period is a
full account preserved. It took place in Westminster Hall after the
wedding of Prince Arthur with Katharine of Spain on November 18, 1501,
and was ‘convayed and showed in pageants proper and subtile.’ There was
a castle, bearing singing children and eight disguised ladies, amongst
whom was one ‘apparelled like unto the Princesse of Spaine,’ a Ship in
which came Hope and Desire as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span> Ambassadors, and a Mount of Love, from
which issued eight knights, and assaulted the castle. This allegorical
compliment, which was set forth by ‘countenance, speeches, and
demeanor,’ ended, the knights and ladies danced together and presently
‘avoided.’ Thereupon the royal party themselves fell to dancing<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>.
‘Pageants’ are mentioned in connexion with other disguisings of the
reign, and on one occasion the disguising was ‘for a moryce<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a>.’
Further light is thrown upon the nature of a disguising by the
regulations contained in a contemporary book of ‘Orders concerning an
Earl’s House.’ A disguising is to be introduced by torch-bearers and
accompanied by minstrels. If there are women disguised, they are to
dance first, and then the men. Then is to come the morris, ‘if any be
ordeynid.’ Finally men and women are to dance together and depart in
the ‘towre, or thing devised for theim.’ The whole performance is to be
under the control of a ‘maister of the disguisinges’ or ‘revills<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a>.’</p>

<p>It is possible to distinguish a simpler and a more elaborate type
of masked entertainment, side by side, throughout the splendid
festivities of the court of Henry VIII. For the more or less impromptu
‘mumming,’ the light-hearted and riotous king had a great liking. In
the first year of his reign we find him invading the queen’s chamber
at Westminster ‘for a gladness to the queen’s grace’ in the guise of
Robin Hood, with his men ‘in green coats and hose of Kentish Kendal’
and a Maid Marian<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a>. The queen subsequently got left out, but there
were many similar disports throughout the reign. One of these, in which
the king and a party disguised as shepherds broke in upon a banquet of
Wolsey’s, has been immortalized by Shakespeare<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>. Such mummings
were comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span> simple, and the Wardrobe was as a rule only called
upon to provide costumes and masks, although on one occasion a lady
in a ‘tryke’ or ‘spell’ wagon was drawn in<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a>. But the more formal
‘disguisings’ of the previous reign were also continued and set forth
with great splendour. In 1527 a ‘House of Revel’ called the ‘Long
House’ was built for their performance and decorated by Holbein<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a>,
and there was constant expenditure on the provision of pageants. ‘The
Golldyn Arber in the Arche-yerd of Plesyer,’ ‘the Dangerus Fortrees,’
‘the Ryche Mount,’ ‘the Pavyllon un the Plas Parlos,’ ‘the Gardyn
de Esperans,’ ‘the Schatew Vert’<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> are some of the names given
to them, and these well suggest the kind of allegorical spectacular
entertainment, diversified with dance and song, which the chroniclers
describe.</p>

<p>The ‘mumming’ or ‘disguising,’ then, as it took shape at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, was a form of court revel, in which, behind
the accretions of literature and pageantry, can be clearly discerned a
nucleus of folk-custom in the entry of the band of worshippers, with
their sacrificial <i>exuviae</i>, to bring the house good luck. The
mummers are masked and disguised folk who come into the hall uninvited
and call upon the company gathered there to dice and dance. It is not
necessary to lay stress upon the distinction between the two terms,
which are used with some indifference. When they first make their
appearance together in the London proclamation of 1418 the masked
visit is a ‘mumming,’ and is included with the ‘enterlude’ under the
generic term of ‘disguising.’ In the Henry VII documents ‘mumming’
does not occur, and in those of Henry VIII ‘mumming’ and ‘disguising’
are practically identical, ‘disguising,’ if anything, being used
of the more elaborate shows, while both are properly distinct from
‘interlude.’ But I do not think that ‘disguising’ ever quite lost
its earlier and widest sense<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>. It must now be added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span> that early
in Henry VIII’s reign a new term was introduced which ultimately
supplanted both the others. The chronicler Hall relates how in 1513
‘On the daie of the Epiphanie at night, the kyng with a xi other were
disguised, after the maner of Italie, called a maske, a thyng not seen
afore in Englande, thei were appareled in garmentes long and brode,
wrought all with gold, with visers and cappes of gold &amp; after the
banket doen, these Maskers came in, with sixe gentlemen disguised in
silke bearyng staffe torches, and desired the ladies to daunce, some
were content, and some that knewe the fashion of it refused, because
it was not a thyng commonly seen. And after thei daunced and commoned
together, as the fashion of the Maske is, thei tooke their leaue and
departed, and so did the Quene, and all the ladies<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a>.’</p>

<p>The good Hall is not particularly lucid in his descriptions, and
historians of the mask have doubted what, beyond the name, was the
exact modification introduced ‘after the maner of Italie’ in 1512.
A recent writer on the subject, Dr. H. A. Evans, thinks that it lay
in the fact that the maskers danced with the spectators, as well
as amongst themselves<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a>. But the mummers of 1377 already did
this, although of course the custom may have grown obsolete before
1513. I am rather inclined to regard it as a matter of costume. The
original Revels Account for this year—and Hall’s reports of court
revels are so full that he must surely have had access to some such
source—mentions provision for ‘12 nobyll personages, inparylled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
blew damaske and yelow damaske long gowns and hoods with hats after
the maner of maskelyng in Etaly<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a>.’ Does not this description
suggest that the ‘thing not sene afore in England’ was of the nature
of a domino? In any case from 1513 onwards ‘masks,’ ‘maskelers’ or
‘maskelings’ recur frequently in the notices of the revels<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a>. The
early masks resembled the simpler type of ‘mumming’ rather than the
more elaborate and spectacular ‘disguising,’ but by the end of the
reign both of the older terms had become obsolete, and all Elizabethan
court performances in which the visor and the dance played the leading
parts were indifferently known as masks<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a>. Outside the court,
indeed, the nomenclature was more conservative, and to this day the
village performers who claim the right to enter your house at Christmas
call themselves ‘mummers,’ ‘guisers’ or ‘geese-dancers.’ Sometimes
they merely dance, sing and feast with you, but in most places, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span> a
former chapter has shown, they have adopted from another season of the
year its characteristic rite, which in course of time has grown from
folk-dance into folk-drama<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a>.</p>

<p>I now pass from the mask to another point of contact between the Feast
of Fools and the Tudor revels. This was the <i>dominus festi</i>. A
special officer, told off to superintend the revels, pastimes and
disports of the Christmas season, is found both in the English and
the Scottish court at the end of the fifteenth century. In Scotland
he bore the title of Abbot of Unreason<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a>; in England he was
occasionally the Abbot, but more usually the Lord of Misrule. Away
from court, other local designations present themselves: but Lord of
Misrule or Christmas Lord are the generic titles known to contemporary
literature<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>. The household accounts of Henry VII make mention of a
Lord or Abbot of Misrule for nearly every Christmas in the reign<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a>.
Under Henry VIII a Lord was annually appointed, with one exception,
until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span> 1520<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a>. From that date, the records are not available,
but an isolated notice in 1534 gives proof of the continuance of the
custom<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>. In 1521 a Lord of Misrule held sway in the separate
household of the Princess Mary<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>, and there is extant a letter
from the Princess’s council to Wolsey asking whether it were the royal
pleasure that a similar appointment should be made in 1525<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a>.
Little information can be gleaned as to the functions of the Lord of
Misrule during the first two Tudor reigns. It is clear that he was
quite distinct from the officer known as the ‘Master of the Revels,’
in whose hands lay the preparation and oversight of disguisings or
masks and similar entertainments. The Master of the Revels also makes
his first appearance under Henry VII. Originally he seems to have been
appointed only <i>pro hac vice</i>, from among the officials, such as
the comptroller of the household, already in attendance at court<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a>.
This practice lasted well into the reign of Henry VIII, who was served
in this capacity by such distinguished courtiers, amongst others,
as Sir Henry Guildford and Sir Anthony Browne<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a>. Under them the
preparation of the revels and the custody of the properties were in
the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span> of a permanent minor official. At first such work was done
in the royal Wardrobe, but under Henry VIII it fell to a distinct
‘serjeant’ who was sometimes, but not always, also ‘serjeant’ to the
king’s tents. In 1545, however, a permanent Master of the Revels was
appointed in the person of Sir Thomas Cawarden, one of the gentlemen
of the privy chamber<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a>. Cawarden formed the Revels into a regular
office with a clerk comptroller, yeoman, and clerk, and a head
quarters, at first in Warwick Inn, and afterwards in the precinct of
the dissolved Blackfriars, of which he obtained a grant from the king.
This organization of the Revels endured in substance until after the
Restoration<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a>. Not unnaturally there were some jealousies and
conflicts of authority between the permanent Master of the Revels
and the annual Lord of Misrule, and this comes out amusingly enough
from some of Cawarden’s correspondence for 1551-3, preserved in the
muniment room at Loseley. For the two Christmases during this period
the Lordship of Misrule was held by George Ferrers, one of the authors
of the <i>Mirrour for Magistrates</i><a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>; and Cawarden seems to
have put every possible difficulty in the way of the discharge of his
duties. Ferrers appealed to the lords of the council, and it took half
a dozen official letters, signed by the great master of the household,
Mr. Secretary Cecil, and a number of other dignitaries, to induce the
Master of the Revels to provide the hobby horses and fool’s coat and
what not, that were required<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>. Incidentally this correspondence
and the account books kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span> by Cawarden give some notion of the sort of
amusement which the Lord of Misrule was expected to organize. In 1551
he made his entry into court ‘out of the mone.’ He had his fool ‘John
Smith’ in a ‘vice’s coote’ and a ‘dissard’s hoode,’ a part apparently
played by the famous court fool, Will Somers. He had a ‘brigandyne’; he
had his ‘holds, prisons, and places of execuc’on, his cannypie, throne,
seate, pillory, gibbet, hedding block, stocks, little ease, and other
necessary incydents to his person’; he had his ‘armury’ and his stables
with ‘13 hobby horses, whereof one with 3 heads for his person, bought
of the carver for his justs and challenge at Greenwich.’ The masks this
year were of apes and bagpipes, of cats, of Greek worthies, and of
‘medyoxes’ (‘double visaged, th’ one syde lyke a man, th’ other lyke
death’)<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a>. The chief difficulty with Cawarden arose out of a visit
to be paid by the Lord to London on January 4. The apparel provided
for his ‘viij counsellors’ on that occasion was so ‘insufficient’ that
he returned it, and told Cawarden that he had ‘mistaken y<sup>e</sup> persons
that sholde weere them, as S<sup>r</sup> Rob<sup>t</sup> Stafford and Thom<sup>s</sup> Wyndesor,
w<sup>h</sup> other gentlemen that stande also upon their reputac̃on, and wold
not be seen in London, so torche-berer lyke disgysed, for as moche
as they are worthe or hope to be worthe<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>.’ After all it took a
letter from the council to get the fresh apparel ready in time. It was
ready, for Machyn’s <i>Diary</i> records the advent of the Lord and his
‘consell’ to Tower Wharf, with a ‘mores danse,’ and the ‘proclamasyon’
made of him at the Cross in Cheap, and his visit to the mayor and the
lord treasurer, ‘and so to Bysshopgate, and so to Towre warff, and
toke barge to Grenwyche<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a>.’ Before the following Christmas of 1552
Ferrers was careful to send note of his schemes to Cawarden in good
time<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>. This year he would come in in ‘blewe’ out of ‘<i>vastum
vacuum</i>, the great waste.’ The ‘serpente with sevin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span> heddes called
hidra’ was to be his arms, his crest a ‘wholme bush’ and his ‘worde’
<i>semper ferians</i>. Mr. Windham was to be his admiral, Sir George
Howard his master of the horse, and he required six councillors, ‘a
divine, a philosopher, an astronomer, a poet, a phisician, a potecarie,
a m<sup>r</sup> of requests, a sivilian, a disard, John Smyth, two gentleman
ushers, besides jugglers, tomblers, fooles, friers, and suche other.’
Again there was a challenge with hobby horses, and again the Lord of
Misrule visited London on January 6, and was met by Sergeant Vauce,
Lord of Misrule to ‘master Maynard the Shreyff’ whom he knighted.
He then proceeded to dinner with the Lord Mayor<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>. As he rode
his cofferer cast gold and silver abroad, and Cawarden’s accounts
show that ‘coynes’ were made for him by a ‘wyer-drawer,’ after the
familiar fashion of the Boy Bishops in France<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>. These accounts
also give elaborate details of his dress and that of his retinue, and
of a ‘Triumph of Venus and Mars<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a>.’ In the following year Edward
was dead, and neither Mary nor Elizabeth seems to have revived the
appointment of a Lord of Misrule at court<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>.</p>

<p>But the reign of the Lord of Misrule extended far beyond the verge
of the royal palace. He was especially in vogue at those homes of
learning, the Universities and the Inns of Court, where Christmas,
though a season of feasting and <i>ludi</i>, had not yet become
an occasion for general ‘going down.’ Anthony à Wood records him
in several Oxford colleges, especially in Merton and St. John’s,
and ascribes his downfall, justly, no doubt, in part, to the
Puritans<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a>. At Merton he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span> bore the title of <i>Rex fabarum</i>
or <i>Rex regni fabarum</i><a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a>. He was a fellow of the college,
was elected on November 19, and held office until Candlemas, when
the winter festivities closed with the <i>Ignis Regentium</i> in the
hall. The names of various <i>Reges fabarum</i> between 1487 and 1557
are preserved in the college registers, and the last holder of the
office elected in the latter year was Joseph Heywood, the uncle of
John Donne, in his day a famous recusant<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a>. At St. John’s College
a ‘Christmas Lord, or Prince of the Revells,’ was chosen up to 1577.
Thirty years later, in 1607, the practice was for one year revived, and
a detailed account of this experiment was committed to manuscript by
one Griffin Higgs<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a>. The Prince, who was chosen on All Saints’ day,
was Thomas Tucker. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span> was installed on November 5, and immediately
made a levy upon past and present members of the college to meet
the necessary expenses. Amongst the subscribers was ‘Mr. Laude.’ On
St. Andrew’s day, the Prince was publicly installed with a dramatic
‘deuise’ or ‘showe’ called <i>Ara Fortunae</i>. The hall was a great
deal too full, a canopy fell down, and the ‘fool’ broke his staff.
On St. Thomas’s day, proclamation was made of the style and title of
the Prince and of the officers who formed his household<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a>. He
also ratified the ‘Decrees and Statutes’ promulgated in 1577 by his
predecessor and added some rather pretty satire on the behaviour of
spectators at college and other revels. On Christmas day the Prince
was attended to prayers, and took the vice-president’s chair in hall,
where a boar’s head was brought in, and a carol sung. After supper was
an interlude, called <i>Saturnalia</i>. On St. John’s day ‘some of the
Prince’s honest neighbours of St. Giles’s presented him with a maske
or morris’; and the ‘twelve daies’ were brought in with appropriate
speeches. On December 29 was a Latin tragedy of <i>Philomela</i>, and
the Prince, who played Tereus, accidentally fell. On New Year’s day
were the Prince’s triumphs, introduced by a ‘shew’ called <i>Time’s
Complaint</i>; and the honest chronicler records that this performance
‘in the sight of the whole University’ was ‘a messe of absurdityes,’
and that ‘two or three cold plaudites’ much discouraged the revellers.
However, they went on with their undertaking. On January 10 were two
shews, one called <i>Somnium Fundatoris</i>, and the other <i>The Seven
Days of the Weeke</i>. The dearth in the city caused by a six weeks’
frost made the President inclined to stop the revels, as in a time of
‘generall wo and calamity’; but happily a thaw came, and on January
15 the college retrieved its reputation by a most successful public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
performance of a comedy <i>Philomathes</i>. <i>The Seven Days of the
Weeke</i>, too, though acted in private, had been so good that the
vice-chancellor was invited to see a repetition of it, and thus Sunday,
January 17, was ‘spent in great mirth.’ On the Thursday following there
was a little <i>contretemps</i>. The canons of Christ Church invited
the Prince to a comedy called <i>Yuletide</i>, and in this ‘many things
were either ill ment by them, or ill taken by vs.’ The play in fact was
full of satire of ‘Christmas Lords,’ and it is not surprising that an
apology from the dean, who was vice-chancellor that year, was required
to soothe the Prince’s offended feelings. Term had now begun, but the
revels were renewed about Candlemas. On that day was a <i>Vigilate</i>
or all-night sitting, with cards, dice, dancing, and a mask. At supper
a quarrel arose. A man stabbed his fellow, and the Prince’s stocks
were requisitioned in deadly earnest. After supper the Prince was
entertained in the president’s lodging with ‘a wassall called the five
bells of Magdalen church.’ On February 6, ‘beeing egge Satterday,’
some gentlemen scholars of the town brought a mask of <i>Penelope’s
Wooers</i> to the Prince, which, however, fell through; and finally, on
Shrove Tuesday, after a shew called <i>Ira seu Tumulus Fortunae</i>,
the Prince was conducted to his private chamber in a mourning
procession, and his reign ended. Even yet the store of entertainment
provided was not exhausted. On the following Saturday, though it was
Lent, an English tragedy of <i>Periander</i> was given, the press of
spectators being so great that ‘4 or 500’ who could not get in caused
a tumult. And still there remained ‘many other thinges entended,’ but
unperformed. There was the mask of <i>Penelope’s Wooers</i>, with
the <i>State of Telemachus</i> and a <i>Controversy of Irus and his
Ragged Company</i>. There were an <i>Embassage from Lubberland</i>, a
<i>Creation of White Knights of the Order of Aristotle’s Well</i>, a
<i>Triumph of all the Founders of Colleges in Oxford</i>, not to speak
of a lottery ‘for matters of mirth and witt’ and a court leet and baron
to be held by the Prince. So much energy and invention in one small
college is astonishing, and it was hard that Mr. Griffin Higgs should
have to complain of the treatment meted out to its entertainers by the
University at large. ‘Wee found ourselves,’ he says, ‘(wee will say
justly)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span> taxed for any the least errour (though ingenious spirits would
have pardoned many things, where all things were entended for their
owne pleasure) but most vnjustly censured, and envied for that which
was done (wee daresay) indifferently well.’</p>

<p>Amongst other colleges in which the Lord of Misrule was regularly
or occasionally chosen, Anthony à Wood names, with somewhat vague
references, New College and Magdalen<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a>. To these may certainly
be added Trinity, where the <i>Princeps Natalicius</i> is mentioned
in an audit-book of 1559<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>. But the most singular of all the
Oxford documents bearing on the subject cannot be identified with
any particular college. It consists of a series of three Latin
letters<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a>. The first is addressed by <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> to
all mortals <i>sub Natalicia ditione degentibus</i>. They are bidden
keep peace during the festal season and wished pleasant headaches
in the mornings. The vicegerent of <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> upon
earth is an annually constituted <i>praelatia</i>, that so a longer
term of office may not beget tyranny. The letter goes on to confirm
the election to the kingly dignity of Robertus Grosteste<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a>, and
enjoins obedience to him <i>secundum Natalicias leges</i>. It is
<i>datum in aere luminoso supra Bethlemeticam regionem ubi nostra
magnificentia fuit pastoribus promulgata</i>. The second letter is
addressed to <i>R[obert] Regi Natalicio</i> and his <i>proceres</i>
by <i>Discretio virtutum omnium parens pariter ac regina</i>. It is
a long discourse on the value of moderation, and concludes with a
declaration that a moderate <i>laetitia</i> shall rule until Candlemas,
and then give way to a moderate <i>clerimonia</i>. The third is more
topical and less didactic in its tone. It parodies a papal letter
to a royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span> sovereign. <i>Transaetherius, pater patrum ac totius
ecclesiasticae monarchiae pontifex et minister</i> complains, <i>R.
Regi Natalicio</i>, of certain abuses of his rule. His <i>stolidus
senescallus</i>, <i>madidus marescallus</i> and <i>parliamenti
grandiloquus sed nugatorius prolocutor</i> have <i>ut plura possent
inferre stipendia</i> assaulted and imprisoned on the very night of
the Nativity, <i>Iohannem Curtibiensem episcopum</i>. In defence of
these proceedings the Rex has pleaded <i>quasdam antiquas regni tui,
non dico consuetudines, sed potius corruptelas</i>. Transaetherius
gives the peccant officials three hours in which to make submission.
If they fail, they shall be excommunicated, and Iohannes de Norwico,
the warden of Jericho, will have orders to debar them from that place
and confine them to their rooms. The letter is <i>datum in vertice
Montis Cancari, pontificatus nostri anni non fluxibili sed aeterno</i>.
I think it is clear that these letters are not a mere political skit,
but refer to some actual Christmas revels. The waylaying of <i>Iohannes
Curtibiensis episcopus</i> to make him ‘pay his footing’ is exactly
the sort of thing that happened at the Feast of Fools, and the <i>non
consuetudines, sed potius corruptelas</i> is the very language of
the decretal of 1207<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a>. But surely they are not twelfth-or early
thirteenth-century revels, as they must be if ‘Robertus Grosteste’
is taken literally as the famous bishop of Lincoln<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a>. There was
no <i>parliamenti prolocutor</i>, for instance, in his day. They
are fourteenth-, fifteenth-, or even sixteenth-century fooling, in
connexion with some <i>Rex Natalicius</i> who adopted, to season his
jest, the name of the great mediaeval legislator against all such
<i>ludi</i>.</p>

<p>At Cambridge an order of the Visitors of Edward VI in 1549 forbade the
appointment of a <i>dominus ludorum</i> in any college<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a>. But the
prohibition did not endure, and more than one unsuccessful Puritan
endeavour to put down Lords of Misrule is recorded by Fuller<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a>.
Little, however, is known of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span> the Cambridge Lords; their bare existence
at St. John’s<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> and Christ’s Colleges<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a>; and at Trinity the
fact that they were called <i>imperatores</i>, a name on the invention
of which one of the original fellows of the college, the astronomer
John Dee, plumes himself<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a>. At schools such as Winchester and Eton,
the functions of Lord of Misrule were naturally supplied by the Boy
Bishop. At Westminster there was a <i>paedonomus</i>, and Bryan Duppa
held the office early in the seventeenth century<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a>.</p>

<p>The revels of the Inns of Court come into notice in 1422, when the
<i>Black Book</i> of Lincoln’s Inn opens with the announcement <i>Ceux
sont les nouns de ceux qe fuerunt assignes de continuer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span> yci le
nowel</i><a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a>. They are mentioned in the <i>Paston Letters</i> in
1451<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a>, and in Sir Fortescue’s <i>De laudibus Legum Angliae</i>
about 1463<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a>. Space compels me to be very brief in summarizing the
further records for each Inn.</p>

<p>Lincoln’s Inn had in 1430 its four revels on All Hallows’ day, St.
Erkenwold’s (April 30), Candlemas and Midsummer day, under a ‘Master of
the Revels.’ In 1455 appears a ‘marshal,’ who was a Bencher charged to
keep order and prevent waste from the last week of Michaelmas to the
first of Hilary term. Under him were the Master of the Revels, a butler
and steward for Christmas, a constable-marshal, server, and cup-bearer.
In the sixteenth century the ‘grand Christmassings’ were additional
to the four revels, and those of Candlemas were called the ‘post
revels.’ Christmas had its ‘king.’ In 1519 it was ordered that the
‘king’ should sit on Christmas day, that on Innocents’ day the ‘King of
Cokneys’<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> should ‘sytt and haue due seruice,’ and that the marshal
should himself sit as king on New Year’s day. In 1517 some doors had
been broken by reason of ‘Jake Stray,’ apparently a popular anti-king
or pretender, and the order concludes, ‘Item, that Jack Strawe and all
his adherentes be from hensforth uttrely banyshed and no more to be
used in Lincolles Inne.’ In 1520 the Bench determine ‘that the order of
Christmas shall be broken up’; and from that date a ‘solemn Christmas’
was only occasionally kept, by agreement with the Temples. Both
Lincoln’s Inn and the Middle Temple had a ‘Prince,’ for instance, in
1599. In 1616 the choice of a ‘Lieutenant’ at Christmas was forbidden
by the Bench as ‘not accordinge to the auncyant Orders and usages of
the House.’ In 1624 the Christmas vacation ceased to be kept. There
were still ‘revels’ under ‘Masters of the Revels’ in Michaelmas and
Hilary terms, and there are notices of disorder at Christmas in 1660
and 1662. But the last ‘Prince’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span> of Lincoln’s Inn, was probably the
Prince de la Grange of 1661, who had the honour of entertaining Charles
II<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>.</p>

<p>The Inner Temple held ‘grand Christmasses’ as well as ‘revels’ on All
Saints’, Candlemas, and Ascension days. The details of the Christmas
ceremonies have been put together from old account books by Dugdale.
They began on St. Thomas’s day and ended on Twelfth night. On Christmas
day came in the boar’s head. On St. Stephen’s day a cat and a fox
were hunted with nine or ten couple of hounds round the hall<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a>.
In the first few days of January a banquet with a play and mask was
given to the other Inns of Court and Chancery. The Christmas officers
included a steward, marshal, butler, constable-marshal, master of the
game, lieutenant of the tower, and one or more masters of the revels.
The constable-marshal was the Lord of Misrule. He held a fantastic
court on St. Stephen’s day<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a>, and came into hall ‘on his mule’
to devise sport on the banquetting night. In 1523 the Bench agreed
not to keep Christmas, but to allow minstrels to those who chose to
stay. Soon after 1554 the Masters of Revels cease to be elected<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a>.
Nevertheless there was a notable revel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span> in 1561 at which Lord Robert
Dudley, afterwards earl of Leicester, was constable-marshal. He took
the title of ‘Palaphilos, prince of Sophie,’ and instituted an order of
knights of Pegasus in the name of his mistress Pallas<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a>. In 1594
the Inner Temple had an emperor, who sent an ambassador to the revels
of Gray’s Inn<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>. In 1627 the appointment of a Lord of Misrule led
to a disturbance between the ‘Temple Sparks’ and the city authorities.
The ‘lieutenant’ claimed to levy a ‘droit’ upon dwellers in Ram Alley
and Fleet Street. The lord mayor intervened, an action which led to
blows and the committal of the lieutenant to the counter, whence he
escaped only by obtaining the mediation of the attorney-general, and
making submission<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a>. A set of orders for Christmas issued by the
Bench in 1632 forbade ‘any going abroad out of the Circuit of this
House, or without any of the Gates, by any Lord or other Gentleman, to
break open any House, or Chamber; or to take anything in the name of
Rent, or a distress<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Middle Temple held its ‘solemn revels’ and ‘post revels’ on All
Saints and Candlemas days, and on the Saturdays between these dates;
likewise its ‘solemn Christmasses<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a>.’ An account of the Christmas
of 1599 was written by Sir Benjamin Rudyerd under the title of
<i>Noctes Templariae: or, A Briefe Chronicle of the Dark Reigne of the
Bright Prince of Burning Love</i>. ‘Sur Martino’ was the Prince, and
one ‘Milorsius Stradilax’ served as butt and buffoon to the company. A
masque and barriers at court, other masques and comedies, a progress, a
mock trial, a ‘Sacrifice of Love,’ visits to the Lord Mayor and to and
from Lincoln’s Inn, made up the entertainment<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a>. In 1631 orders for
Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span> government were made by the Bench<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a>. In 1635 a Cornish
gentleman, Francis Vivian, sat as Prince d’Amour. It cost him £2,000,
but after his deposition he was knighted at Whitehall. His great day
was February 24, when he entertained the Princes Palatine, Charles,
and Rupert, with Davenant’s masque of the <i>Triumphs of the Prince
d’Amour</i><a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a>.</p>

<p>There is no very early mention of revels at Gray’s Inn, but they were
held on Saturdays between All Saints and Candlemas about 1529, and by
1550 the solemn observation of Christmas was occasionally used. In 1585
the Bench forbade that any one should ‘in time of Christmas, or any
other time, take upon him, or use the name, place, or commandment of
<i>Lord</i>, or any such other like<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>.’ Nevertheless in 1594 one
of the most famous of all the legal ‘solemn Christmasses’ was held at
this Inn. Mr. Henry Helmes, of Norfolk, was ‘Prince of Purpoole<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a>,’
and he had the honour of presenting a mask before Elizabeth. This was
written by Francis Davison, and Francis Bacon also contributed to the
speeches at the revels. But the great glory of this Christmas came to
it by accident. On Innocents’ day there had been much confusion, and
the invited Templarians had retired in dudgeon. To retrieve the evening
‘a company of base and common fellows’ was brought in and performed ‘a
Comedy of Errors, like to Plautus his Menaechmus<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a>.’ In 1617 there
was again a Prince of Purpoole, on this occasion for the entertainment
of Bacon himself as Lord Chancellor<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a>. Orders of 1609 and 1628
mention respectively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span> the ‘twelve’ and the ‘twenty’ days of Christmas
as days of license, when caps may be doffed and cards or dice played in
the hall<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a>: and the duration of the Gray’s Inn revels is marked by
notices of Masters of the Revels as late as 1682 and even 1734<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a>.</p>

<p>Nobles and even private gentlemen would set up a Lord of Misrule
in their houses. The household regulations of the fifth earl of
Northumberland include in a list of rewards usually paid about 1522,
one of twenty shillings if he had an ‘Abbot of Miserewll’ at Christmas,
and this officer, like his fellow at court, was distinct from the
‘Master of the Revells’ for whom provision is also made<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a>. In
1556 the marquis of Winchester, then lord treasurer, had a ‘lord of
mysrulle’ in London, who came to bid my lord mayor to dinner with ‘a
grett mene of musysyonars and dyssegyssyd’ amongst whom ‘a dullvyll
shuting of fyre’ and one ‘lyke Deth with a dart in hand<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>.’ In 1634
Richard Evelyn of Wotton, high sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, issued
‘Articles’ appointing Owen Flood his trumpeter ‘Lord of Misrule of all
good Orders during the twelve dayes<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a>.’ The custom was imitated by
more than one municipal ape of gentility. The lord mayor and sheriffs
of London had their Lords of Misrule until the court of common council
put down the expense in 1554<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a>. Henry Rogers, mayor of Coventry,
in 1517, and Richard Dutton, mayor of Chester, in 1567, entertained
similar officers<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a>.</p>

<p>I have regarded the Lord of Misrule, amongst the courtly and wealthy
classes of English society, as a direct offshoot from the vanished
Feast of Fools. The ecclesiastical suggestion in the alternative
title, more than once found, of ‘Abbot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span> of Misrule,’ seems to justify
this way of looking at the matter. But I do not wish to press it too
closely. For after all the Lord of Misrule, like the Bishop of Fools
himself, is only a variant of the winter ‘king’ known to the folk. In
some instances it is difficult to say whether it is the folk custom
or the courtly custom with which you have to do. Such is the ‘kyng of
Crestemesse’ of Norwich in 1443<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>. Such are the Lords of Misrule
whom Machyn records as riding to the city from Westminster in 1557
and Whitechapel in 1561<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a>. And there is evidence that the term
was freely extended to folk ‘kings’ set up, not at Christmas only,
but at other times in the year<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a>. It was a folk and a Christmas
Lord whose attempted suppression by Sir Thomas Corthrop, the reforming
curate of Harwich, got him into trouble with the government of
Henry VIII in 1535<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a>. And it was folk rather than courtly Lords
which, when the reformers got their own way, were hardest hit by the
inhibitions contained in the visitation articles of archbishop Grindal
and others<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a>. So this discussion, <i>per ambages atque aequora
vectus</i>, comes round to the point at which it began. It is a far
cry from Tertullian to Bishop Grosseteste and a far cry from Bishop
Grosseteste to Archbishop Grindal, but each alike voices for his own
day the relentless hostility of the austerer clergy during all ages to
the ineradicable <i>ludi</i> of the pagan inheritance.</p>

cf. Prof. Bury in Gibbon, i. l. B. von der Lage, <i>Studien zur

Porphyrius (<i>Acta SS. Sept.</i> v. 37), and another St. Porphyrius
(<i>Acta SS. Nov.</i> ii. 230) are all variants of a Greek story
originally told of an anonymous <i>mimus</i>. The <i>Passio</i> of
St. Genesius represents him as a <i>magister mimithemelae artis</i>,
converted while he was mimicking a baptism before Diocletian and
martyred. It professes to give part of the dialogue of the mime. The
legends of St. Philemon (<i>Menologium Basilii</i>, ii. 59; cf. <i>Acta
SS. Mar.</i> i. 751) and St. Pelagia or Margarita (<i>Acta SS. Oct.</i>

theatro quaedam agi concessisset quae ex vana deorum superstitione
traducta aures Christianae abhorrere videantur.’ Sisebuthus, <i>Ep.</i>

says, ‘obiectum hoc, quod de ludis theatriis taurorum, scilicet,
ministerio sis adeptus nulli videtur incertum; quis non videat quod
etiam videre poeniteat.’ But I cannot find in Sisebut or in Mariana,
who writes Spanish, the words quoted by Du Méril. For ‘taurorum’ one
MS. has ‘phanorum.’ I suspect the former is right. A bull-fight sounds
so Spanish, and such festivals of heathen origin as the <i>Kalends</i>
(cf. ch. xi) were not held in theatres. A. Gassier, <i>Le Théâtre
espagnol</i> (1898), 14, thinks such a festival is intended; if so,
‘theatriis’ probably means not literally, ‘in a theatre,’ but merely
‘theatrical’; cf. the ‘ludi theatrales’ of the Feast of Fools (ch.
xiii). In any case there is no question of ‘scenici.’</p>

rusticum’ and says ‘ex qua victoria carmen publicum iuxta rusticitatem
per omnium pene volitabat ora ita canentium, feminaeque choros inde
plaudendo componebant.’ The <i>Vita S. Faronis</i> in <i>Acta SS.</i>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="label">[106]</a> It is important to recognize that the <i>cantilenae</i>
of the folk and those of the professional singers existed side by
side. Both are, I think, implied in the account of the St. William
songs quoted above: the folk sung them in choruses and on wake-days,
the professional singers in the assemblies of warriors. At any rate,
in the next (twelfth) cent. Ordericus Vitalis, vi. 3 (ed. <i>Soc. de
l’Hist. de France</i>, iii. 5), says of the same Willelmus, ‘Vulgo
canitur a ioculatoribus de illo cantilena.’ M. Gautier (ii. 6) will not
admit the filiation of the <i>ioculatores</i> to the <i>scôpas</i>,
and therefore he is led to suppose (i. 78) that the <i>cantilenae</i>
and <i>vulgaria carmina</i> were all folk-song up to the end of the
tenth cent. and that then the <i>ioculatores</i> got hold of them and
lengthened them into <i>chansons de gestes</i>. But, as we shall see
(p. 34), the Franks certainly had their professional singers as early
as Clovis, and these cannot well have sung anything but heroic lays.
Therefore the <i>cantilenae</i> and <i>vulgaria carmina</i> of the
Merovingian and Carolingian periods may have been either folk-song,
or <i>scôp</i>-song, or, more probably, both (Gröber, ii. 1. 449).
<i>Cantilena</i> really means no more than ‘chant’ of any kind; it
includes ecclesiastical chant. So Alcuin uses it (e. g. <i>Ep.</i> civ.
in Dümmler, ii. 169); and what Gautier, ii. 65, prints as a folk-song
<i>cantilena</i> of S. Eulalia is treated by Gröber, ii. 1. 442, as a
sequence.</p>

buffoon is looked askance at by the dignified Scandinavian men of

developed their buffoons for themselves, independently of Roman
influence, but so far as the Germans go, Tacitus, <i>Germ.</i> 24,

in his youth, but the patron saints of the minstrels were always St.

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="label">[247]</a> Another version of this story is given by Petrus Cantor
(ob. 1197), <i>Verbum Abbreviatum</i>, c. 84 (<i>P. L.</i> ccv. 254)
‘Ioculatori cuidam papa Alexander (Alex. III) nec concessit vivere de
officio suo, nec ei penitus interdixit.’ In c. 49 of the same work
Petrus Cantor inveighs learnedly <i>Contra dantes histrionibus</i>.
Doubtless the Alexander in question is Alexander III (1159-81), though
the (Alex. III) above may be due to the seventeenth-century editor,
Galopinus. A hasty glance at the voluminous and practically unindexed
decrees and letters of Alexander III in <i>P. L.</i> cc. and Jaffé,
<i>Regesta Pontificum Romanorum</i> (ed. 2, 1885-8), ii. 145-418, has
not revealed the source of the story; and I doubt whether the Pope’s
decision, if it was ever given, is to be found in black and white. The
two reports of it by Thomas de Cabham and Petrus Cantor are barely
consistent. In any case, it never got into the Gregorian Decretals.</p>

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="label">[251]</a> Hubatsch, 15. The origin, precise meaning, and mutual
relations of the terms <i>Golias</i>, <i>goliardi</i> are uncertain.
Probably the goliardic literature arose in France, rather than in
England with Walter Mapes, the attribution to whom of many of the
poems is perhaps due to a confusion of G[olias] with G[ualterus] in
the MSS. Giraldus Cambrensis (ob. 1217), <i>Speculum Ecclesiae</i>,
says ‘Parasitus quidam Golias nomine nostris diebus gulositate pariter
et leccacitate famosissimus&nbsp;...&nbsp;in papam et curiam Romanam carmina
famosa&nbsp;...&nbsp;evomuit’: but the following note points to a much earlier
origin for Golias and his <i>pueri</i>, and this is upheld by W.
Scherer, <i>Gesch. d. deutsch. Dichtung im 11. und 12. Jahrh. 16.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_252" href="#FNanchor_252" class="label">[252]</a> Early decrees forbidding the clergy to be
<i>ioculatores</i> are given on p. 39. More precise is the order of
Gautier of Sens (†913) in his <i>Constitutiones</i>, c. 13 (Mansi,
xviii. 324) ‘Statuimus quod clerici ribaldi, maxime qui dicuntur de
familia Goliae, per episcopos, archidiaconos, officiales, et decanos
Christianitatis, tonderi praecipiantur vel etiam radi, ita quod eis
non remaneat tonsura clericalis: ita tamen quod sine periculo et
scandalo ita fiant.’ If Mansi’s date is right, this precedes by three
centuries the almost identical <i>Conc. of Rouen</i>, c. 8 (Mansi,
xxiii. 215), and <i>Conc. of Castle Gonther</i> (Tours), c. 21 (Mansi,
xxiii. 237), both in 1231. Gautier, <i>Les Tropaires</i>, i. 186,
dwells on the influence of the <i>goliardi</i> on the late and ribald
development of the tropes, and quotes <i>Conc. of Treves</i> (1227), c.
9 (Mansi, xxiii. 33) ‘praecipimus ut omnes sacerdotes non permittant
trutannos et alios vagos scholares aut goliardos cantare versus super
<i>Sanctus</i> et <i>Agnus Dei</i>.’ On their probable share in the
Feast of Fools cf. ch. xiv. For later legislation cf. Hubatsch, 14, 95,
and the passage from the <i>Liber Sextus</i> of Boniface VIII on p. 39.
It lasts to the <i>Conc. Frisingense</i> (1440) ‘statuimus ne clerici
mimis, ioculatoribus, histrionibus, buffonibus, galliardis, largiantur’
(Labbe, xiii. 1286). By this time ‘goliard’ seems little more than a
synonym for ‘minstrel.’ The ‘mynstralle, a gulardous,’ of Mannyng,
148, does not appear to be a clerk, while Chaucer’s ‘goliardeys’ is
the Miller (<i>C. T.</i> prol. 560). On the other hand, Langland’s
‘Goliardeys, a glotoun of wordes’ (<i>Piers Plowman</i>, prol. 139),
speaks Latin. Another name for the <i>goliardi</i> occurs in an
<i>Epistola Guidonis S. Laurentii in Lucina Cardinalis</i>, xx. (1266,
Hartzheim, iii. 807) against ‘vagi scolares, qui Eberdini vocantur,’
and who ‘divinum invertunt officium, unde laici scandalizantur.’</p>

Percy gave the mediaeval minstrel as high a status as the Norse
<i>scald</i> or Anglo-Saxon <i>scôp</i>. This led to an acrid criticism
by Ritson who, in his essay <i>On the ancient English Minstrels</i>
in <i>Ancient Songs and Ballads</i> (1829), easily showed the low
repute in which many minstrels were held. See also his elaborate
<i>Dissertation on Romance and Minstrelsy</i> in his <i>Ancient English
Metrical Romances</i> (1802). The truth really lay between the two, for
neither appreciated the wide variety covered by a common name. On the
controversy, cf. Minto in <i>Enc. Brit.</i> s. v. <i>Minstrels</i>,
Courthope, i. 426-31, and H. B. Wheatley’s Introduction to his edition
of Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>, xiii-xv. Percy in his later editions
profited largely by Ritson’s criticism; a careful collation of these is
given in Schroer’s edition (1889).</p>

<i>Literature of the Kymry</i>, 84, 93, 97, 102; Ernest David,
<i>Études historiques sur la Poésie et la Musique dans la Cambrie</i>,
13, 62-103, 147-64. In Wales, an isolated corner of Europe, little
touched by Latin influences, the bards long retained the social and
national position which it is probable they once had held in all
the Aryan peoples. Their status is defined in the laws of Howel Dha
(†920) and in those of Gruffyd ab Cynan (1100). The latter code
distinguishes three orders of bards proper, the <i>Pryddyd</i> or Chair
bards, the <i>Teuluwr</i> or Palace bards, and the <i>Arwyddfardd</i>
or heralds, also called <i>Storiawr</i>, the <i>cantores historici</i>
of Giraldus Cambrensis. The <i>Pryddyd</i> and <i>Teuluwr</i>
differ precisely as poets and executants, <i>trouvères</i> and
<i>jougleurs</i>. Below all these come the <i>Clerwr</i>, against
whom official bardism from the sixth to the thirteenth century showed
an inveterate animosity. These are an unattached wandering folk,
players on flutes, tambourines, and other instruments meaner than
the <i>telyn</i> or harp, and the <i>crwth</i> or viol which alone
the bards proper deigned to use. Many of them had also picked up the
mime-tricks of the foreigners. It was probably with these <i>Clerwr</i>
that the English and French neighbours of the Kelts came mainly into
contact. Padelford, 5, puts this contact as early as the Anglo-Saxon
period.</p>

repraesentando personas.’ All these passages, like the ninth-century

the mime Vitalis (Riese, <i>Anth. Lat.</i> i. 2. 143; Baehrens, <i>P.

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_323" href="#FNanchor_323" class="label">[323]</a> A ‘japer’ is often an idle talker, like a ‘jangler’
which is clearly sometimes confused with a ‘jongleur’; cf. Chaucer,
<i>Parson’s Tale</i>, 89 ‘He is a japere and a gabber and no verray
repentant that eft-soone dooth thing for which hym oghte repente.’
Langland uses the term in a more technical sense. <i>Activa Vita</i>
in <i>Piers Plowman</i>, xvi. 207, is no minstrel, because ‘Ich
can not&nbsp;...&nbsp;japen ne jogelen.’ No doubt a ‘jape’ would include
a <i>fabliau</i>. It is equivalent etymologically to ‘gab,’ and
Bédier, 33, points out that the <i>jougleurs</i> use <i>gabet</i>,
as well as <i>bourde</i>, <i>trufe</i>, and <i>risée</i> for a
<i>fabliau</i>.—The use of ‘pleye’ as ‘jest’ may be illustrated by
Chaucer, <i>Pardoner’s Tale</i> (<i>C. T.</i> 12712) ‘My wit is greet,
though that I bourde and pleye.’—The ‘japis’ of the <i>Tretise</i>
are probably the ‘knakkes’ of the passage on ‘japeris’ in <i>Parson’s
Tale</i>, 651 ‘right so conforten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of
japeris hem that travaillen in the service of the devel.’</p>

Grosseteste’s predecessor, Hugh de Wells, in 1230 (Wilkins, i. 627),
but he, like Roger Weseham, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in 1252
(<i>Annales Monastici</i>, R. S. i. 296), merely condemns <i>ludi</i>,

irae, odii, pugnae, et homicidii.’ His <i>Constitutiones</i> of 1238
say ‘Praecipimus etiam ut in singulis ecclesiis denuncietur solenniter
ne quisquam levet arietes super rotas, vel alios ludos statuat, in
quibus decertatur pro bravio: nec huiusmodi ludis quisquam intersit,
&amp;c.’ About 1244 he wrote again to the archdeacons: ‘Faciunt etiam, ut
audivimus, clerici ludos quos vocant miracula: et alios ludos quos
vocant Inductionem Maii sive Autumni; et laici scotales&nbsp;...&nbsp;miracula

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_357" href="#FNanchor_357" class="label">[357]</a> Frazer, <i>G. B.</i> i. 9 ‘The fundamental principles
on which it [savage magic] is based would seem to be reducible to
two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its
cause; and second, that things which have once been in contact, but
have ceased to be so, continue to act upon each other as if the contact
still persisted. From the first of these principles, the savage infers
that he can produce any desired effect merely by imitating it; from
the second he concludes that he can influence at pleasure and at any
distance any person of whom, or any thing of which, he possesses a
particle. Magic of the latter sort, resting as it does on the belief
in a certain secret sympathy which unites indissolubly things that
have once been connected with each other may appropriately be termed
sympathetic in the strict sense of the term. Magic of the former kind,
in which the supposed cause resembles or simulates the supposed effect,
may conveniently be described as imitative or mimetic.’ Cf. Jevons,
31 ‘The savage makes the generalization that like produces like; and
then he is provided with the means of bringing about anything he
wishes, for to produce an effect he has only to imitate it. To cause
a wind to blow, he flaps a blanket, as the sailor still whistles to
bring a whistling gale.... If the vegetation requires rain, all that
is needed is to dip a branch in water, and with it to sprinkle the
ground. Or a spray of water squirted from the mouth will produce a mist
sufficiently like the mist required to produce the desired effect;
or black clouds of smoke will be followed by black clouds of rain.’
I do not feel that magic is altogether a happy term for this sort of
savage science. In its ordinary sense (the ‘black art’), it certainly
contains a large element of what Dr. Frazer distinguishes from magic
as religion, ‘a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man
which are believed to direct and control the course of nature and of
human life.’ True, these powers are not to whom the orthodox religion
is directed, but the approach to them is religious in the sense of the
above definition. Such magic is in fact an amalgam of charms, which are
Dr. Frazer’s ‘magic,’ and spells, which are his ‘religion.’ But so are
many more recognized cults.</p>

their history ‘acquainted with the rudiments of agriculture,’ but
‘still possessed with nomadic tendencies.’ He adds that considerable
progress must have been made before the dispersion of the European
branches, and points out that agriculture would naturally develop
when the migratory hordes from the steppes reached the great forests
of central Europe. For this there would be two reasons, the greater
fertility of the soil and the narrowed space for pasturage. On the
other hand, V. Hehn, <i>Culturpflanzen und Haustiere</i>, and Mommsen,
<i>Hist. of Rome</i>, i. 16, find the traces of agriculture amongst
the undivided Indo-Europeans very slight; the word yáva-ζέα, which is

Christian colouring, but retains many primitive features. Strips of
turf are removed, and masses said over them. They are replaced after
oil, honey, barm, milk of every kind of cattle, twigs of every tree,
and holy water have been put on the spot. Seed is bought at a double
price from almsmen and poured into a hole in the plough with salt and
herbs. Various invocations are used, including one which calls on
‘Erce, Erce, Erce, Eorthan modor,’ and implores the Almighty to grant
her fertility. Then the plough is driven, and a loaf, made of every
kind of corn with milk and holy water, laid under the first furrow.

contact with the Romans; cf. Tacitus, <i>Germ.</i> 26 ‘annum quoque
ipsum non in totidem digerunt species: hiems et ver et aestas
intellectum ac vocabula habent, autumni perinde nomen ac bona

tripartition of the year, in this pre-calendar form, was ‘of foreign
extraction.’ Schräder shows that it is common to the Aryan languages.
The Keltic seasons, in particular, seem to be closely parallel to the
Teutonic. Of the three great Keltic feasts described by Rhys, <i>C.
H.</i> 409, 513, 676; <i>C. F.</i> i. 308, the Lugnassad was probably
the harvest feast, the Samhain the old beginning of winter feast,
and the Beltain the high summer feast. The meaning of ‘Beltain’ (cf.
<i>N. E. D.</i> s.v. Beltane) seems quite uncertain. A connexion
is possible but certainly unproved with the Abelio of the Pyrenean
inscriptions, the Belenus-Apollo of those of the eastern Alps, and,
more rarely, Provence (Röscher, <i>Lexicon</i>, s.v. Belenus; Holder,
<i>Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz</i>, s.vv. Belenus, Abelio; Ausonius,
<i>Professores</i>, iv. 7), or the Bel of Bohemia mentioned by Allso
(ch. xii). The Semitic Baal, although a cult of Belus, found its way
into the Roman world (cf. Appendix N, No. xxxii, and Wissowa, 302),
is naturally even a less plausible relation. But it is dear to the
folk-etymologist; cf. e.g. S. M. Mayhew, <i>Baalism</i> in <i>Trans. of

The primitive year was thermometric, not astronomic, its critical
moments, not the solstices, a knowledge of which means science, but
the sensible increase and diminution of heat in spring and autumn.
The solstices came through Rome. The <i>Sermo Eligii</i> (Grimm,
iv. 1737) has ‘nullus in festivitate S. Ioannis vel quibuslibet
sanctorum solemnitatibus solstitia&nbsp;...&nbsp;exerceat,’ but Eligius was
a seventh-century bishop, and this <i>Sermo</i> may have been
interpolated in the eighth century (O. Reich, <i>Über Audoen’s
Lebensbeschreibung des heiligen Eligius</i> (1872), cited in <i>Rev.
celtique</i>, ix. 433). It is not clear that the un-Romanized Teuton
or Kelt made a god of the sun, as distinct from the heaven-god, who
of course has solar attributes and emblems. In the same <i>Sermo</i>
Eligius says ‘nullus dominos solem aut lunam vocet, neque per eos
iuret.’ But the notion of ‘domini’ may be post-Roman, and the oath
is by the permanent, rather than the divine; cf. A. de Jubainville,
<i>Intr. à l’Étude de la Litt. celt.</i> 181. It is noticeable that
German names for the sun are originally feminine and for the moon
masculine.</p>

from <i>spurcus</i>, ‘unclean.’ Pearson, ii. 159, would, however,
trace it to an Aryan root <i>spherag</i>, ‘swell,’ ‘burst,’ ‘shoot.’
Bede, <i>de temp. rat.</i> c. 15, calls February <i>Sol-monath</i>,
which he explains as ‘mensis placentarum.’ September, the month of the
harvest-festival, is <i>Haleg-monath</i>, or ‘mensis sacrorum.’</p>

the fourth century, and the anniversary observed. Gregory the Great
ordered ‘solemnitates ecclesiarum dedicationum per singulos annos sunt
celebrandae.’ The A.-S. <i>Canons</i> of Edgar (960), c. 28 (Wilkins,
i. 227), require them to be kept with sobriety. Originally the
anniversary, as well as the actual dedication day, was observed with an
all night watch, whence the name <i>vigilia</i>, wakes. Belethus, <i>de
rat. offic.</i> (<i>P. L.</i> ccii. 141), c. 137, says that the custom
was abolished owing to the immorality to which it led. But the ‘eve’
of these and other feasts continued to share in the sanctity of the
‘day,’ a practice in harmony with the European sense of the precedence
of night over day (cf. Schräder-Jevons, 311; Bertrand, 267, 354, 413).
An Act of Convocation in 1536 (Wilkins, iii. 823) required all wakes to
be held on the first Sunday in October, but it does not appear to have

negligentibus, vel imperitis, id est in ludis et equorum cursibus, et

who describes them as ‘pro gentilicio Ambarvali,’ and adds, ‘confido

Castleton, <i>F. L.</i> xii. 469) has disappeared, leaving the name
of ‘queen’ to a particular bunch of flowers; also by the ‘giant’ of
the midsummer watch. The Salisbury giant, St. Christopher, with his
hobby-horse, Hob-nob, is described in <i>Rev. d. T. P.</i> iv. 601.</p>

Zacharias and St. Boniface shows that the lighting of the <i>ignis</i>

Gallican from Roman ceremonial in the eighth century (Jaffé, 2291).
All the lights in the church are previously put out, and this itself
has become a ceremony in the <i>Tenebrae</i>. Ecclesiastical symbolism

ipsum sperma vel in puteos vel in aquas fluviales eiiciunt, ex quo

away; and (2) because St. John’s bones were burnt in Sebasta. Torches
are carried, because St. John was a shining light. A wheel is rolled,
because of the solstice, which is made appropriate to St. John by
<i>St. John</i> iii. 30. The account of Belethus is amplified by
Durandus, <i>Rationale Div. Offic.</i> (ed. corr. Antwerp, 1614) vii.

The English term is <i>need-fire</i>, Scotch <i>neidfyre</i>, German

kept warm by exercise and out of mischief while they could not work.’
This is evidently a ‘fake’ of the ‘Puck of commentators.’ Hone, <i>E.

in one of the churches of Paris, a choir boy used to whip a top marked
with <i>Alleluia</i>, written in gold letters, from one end of the

mediaeval perversion of an agricultural rite. On the whole question of

church, but the canons of Evreux on their return from the <i>procession

the Easter <i>pilota</i> of Auxerre which lasted to 1538, took place
in the nave before vespers. Full accounts of this ceremony have been

(<i>F. L.</i> vii. 90) has ‘dances as if in agony.’ On the Mendips
(<i>F. L.</i> v. 339) what is expected is ‘a lamb in the sun.’ The
moon, and perhaps the sun also, is sometimes ‘wobbly,’ ‘jumping’
or ‘skipping,’ owing to the presence of strata of air differing in
humidity or temperature, and so changing the index of refraction
(Nicholson, <i>Golspie</i>, 186). At Pontesford Hill in Shropshire
(Burne-Jackson, 330) the pilgrimage was on Palm Sunday, actually to
pluck a sprig from a haunted yew, traditionally ‘to look for the golden
arrow,’ which must be solar. In the Isle of Man hills, on which are
sacred wells, are visited on the Lugnassad, to gather ling-berries.
Others say that it is because of Jephthah’s daughter, who went up and
down on the mountains and bewailed her virginity. And the old folk now

simply ‘backwards,’ and the equivalence with <i>deasil</i> not earlier

and the undated <i>C. of Braga</i>, c. 80 (quoted on p. 144). Cf.
also the denunciations of the <i>Kalends</i> (ch. xi and Appendix
N). Nearly four centuries after the <i>C. of Rome</i> we find the
<i>C. of Avignon</i> (1209), c. 17 (Mansi, xxii. 791) ‘statuimus, ut
in sanctorum vigiliis in ecclesiis historicae saltationes, obscoeni
motus, seu choreae non fiant, nec dicantur amatoria carmina, vel
cantilenae ibidem....’ Still later the <i>C. of Bayeux</i> (1300), c.
31 (Mansi, xxv. 66) ‘ut dicit Augustinus, melius est festivis diebus
fodere vel arare, quam choreas ducere’; and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.
The pseudo-Augustine <i>Sermo</i>, 265, <i>de Christiano nomine cum
operibus non Christianis</i> (<i>P. L.</i> xxxix. 2237), which is
possibly by Caesarius of Arles, asserts explicitly the pagan character
of the custom: ‘isti enim infelices et miseri homines, qui balationes
et saltationes ante ipsas basilicas sanctorum exercere non metuunt nec
erubescunt, etsi Christiani ad ecclesiam venerint, pagani de ecclesia
revertuntur; quia ista consuetudo balandi de paganorum observatione
remansit.’ A mediaeval preacher (quoted by A. Lecoy de la Marche,
<i>Chaire française au Moyen Âge</i>, 447, from <i>B. N. Lat. MS.</i>
17509, f. 146) declares, ‘chorea enim circulus est cuius centrum est
diabolus, et omnes vergunt ad sinistrum.’</p>

until the seventeenth century only <i>men</i> took part in it. St.

is done by way of vow for such cures. The local legend asserts that

to which religious as well as the secular words are attached, is
technically known as a <i>rota</i> or <i>rondel</i>. It is of the
nature of polyphonic part-song, and of course more advanced than the
typical mediaeval <i>rondet</i> can have been.</p>

Mr. Wilson discredits the tradition that the performance began as a
mass for the obit of Henry VII. The hymn is printed in Dyer, 259;
Ditchfield, 96. It has no relation to the summer festival, having been
written in the seventeenth century by Thomas Smith and set by Benjamin
Rogers as a grace. In other cases hymns have been attached to the
village festivals. At Tissington the well-dressing,’ on Ascension Day
includes a clerical procession in which ‘Rock of Ages’ and ‘A Living
Stream’ are sung (Ditchfield, 187). A special ‘Rushbearers’ Hymn’ was
written for the Grasmere Rushbearing in 1835, and a hymn for St. Oswald
has been recently added (E. G. Fletcher, <i>The Rushbearing</i>, 13,

<p class="hang">Evidently some of these <i>dramatis personae</i> are not
traditional; the ingenuity of the presenter has been at work on them.
‘Bavian’ as a name for the fool, is the Dutch <i>baviaan</i>, ‘baboon.’
His ‘tail’ is to be noted; for the phallic shape sometimes given to the
bladder which he carries, cf. Rigollot, 164. In the Betley window the
fool has a bauble; in the Vinkenboom picture a staff with a bladder at
one end, and a ladle (to gather money in) at the other. In the window
the ladle is carried by the hobby-horse. ‘The hobby-horse is forgot’ is
a phrase occurring in <i>L. L. L.</i> iii. 1. 30; <i>Hamlet</i>, iii.
2. 144, and alluded to by Beaumont and Fletcher, <i>Women Pleased</i>,
iv. 1, and Ben Jonson, in the masque quoted above, and in <i>The

ballad.</p>

several figures. The morris is in request at wakes and rushbearings.
Both men and women dance, sometimes to the number of twenty or thirty.
Gay dresses are worn, with white skirts, knee-breeches and ribbons.
Handkerchiefs are carried or hung on the arm or wrist, or replaced
by dangling streamers, cords, or skeins of cotton. Bells are not
worn on the legs, but jingling horse-collars are sometimes carried
on the body. There is generally a fool, described in one account as
wearing ‘a horrid mask.’ He is, however, generally black, and is known
as ‘King Coffee’ (Gorton), ‘owd sooty-face,’ ‘dirty Bet,’ and ‘owd
molly-coddle.’ This last name, like the ‘molly-dancers’ of Gorton,
seems to be due to a linguistic corruption. In 1829 a writer describes
the fool as ‘a nondescript, made up of the ancient fool and Maid
Marian.’ At Heaton, in 1830, were two figures, said to represent Adam
and Eve, as well as the fool. The masked fool, mentioned above, had as
companion a shepherdess with lamb and crook.</p>

proper is mainly in south Shropshire and at Christmas. At Shrewsbury,
in 1885, were ten dancers, with a fool. Five carried trowels and five
short staves which they clashed. The fool had a black face, and a bell
on his coat. No other bells are mentioned. Staves or wooden swords are
used at other places in Shropshire, and at Brosely all the faces are
black. The traditional music is a tabor and pipe. A 1652 account of the
Brosely dance with six sword-bearers, a ‘leader or lord of misrule’ and
a ‘vice’ (cf. ch. xxv) called the ‘lord’s son’ is quoted. In north-east
Shropshire, the Christmas ‘guisers’ are often called ‘morris-dancers,’
‘murry-dancers,’ or ‘merry-dancers.’ In Shetland the name ‘merry
dancers’ is given to the <i>aurora borealis</i> (J. Spence, <i>Shetland

and gives illustrations. There are always six dancers. A broad garter
of bells is worn below the knee. There are two sets of figures: in one
handkerchiefs are carried, in the other short staves are swung and
clashed. Sometimes the dancers sing to the air, which is that of an
old country-dance. There is always a fool, who carries a stick with a
bladder and cow’s tail, and is called in two places ‘Rodney,’ elsewhere
the ‘squire.’ The music is that of a pipe and tabor (‘whittle’ and
‘dub’) played by one man; a fiddle is now often used. At Bampton there
was a solo dance between crossed tobacco-pipes. At Spelsbury and at
Chipping Warden the dance used to be on the church-tower. At the
Bampton Whit-feast and the Ducklington Whit-hunt, the dancers were
accompanied by a sword-bearer, who impaled a cake. A sword-bearer also
appears in a list of Finstock dancers, given me by Mr. T. J. Carter,
of Oxford. He also told me that the dance on Spelsbury church-tower,
seventy years ago, was by women.</p>

was considered a variety of morisco. Douce, 602; Burton, 124, figure an

to him by J. M. Kemble, from the mouth of an old Yorkshireman: ‘In
some parts of northern England, in Yorkshire, especially Hallamshire,
popular customs show remnants of the worship of Fricg. In the
neighbourhood of Dent, at certain seasons of the year, especially
autumn, the country folk hold a procession and perform old dances, one
called the giant’s dance: the leading giant they name <i>Woden</i>, and
his wife <i>Frigga</i>, the principal action of the play consisting in
two swords being swung and clashed together about the neck of a boy
without hurting him.’ There is nothing about this in the account of
Teutonic mythology in J. M. Kemble’s own <i>Saxons in England</i>. I
do not believe that the names of Woden and Frigga were preserved in
connexion with this custom continuously from heathen times. Probably
some antiquary had introduced them; and in error, for there is no
reason to suppose that the ‘clown’ and ‘woman’ of the sword-dance were
ever thought to represent gods. But the description of the business
with the swords is interesting.</p>

in 1618. Probably it was Reynolds’ invention, and suggested by the

Chaworth Musters, <i>A Cavalier Stronghold</i>, 387. Plough Monday is
the Monday after Twelfth night, when the field work begins. A plough
is dragged round the village and a <i>quête</i> made. The survivals
of the custom are mainly in the north, east and east midlands. In the
city, a banquet marks the day. A Norfolk name is ‘Plowlick Monday,’
and a Hunts one ‘Plough-Witching.’ The plough is called the ‘Fool
Plough,’ ‘Fond Plough,’ ‘Stot Plough’ or ‘White Plough’; the latter
name probably from the white shirts worn (cf. p. 200). At Cropwell,
Notts, horses cut out in black or red adorn these. In Lincolnshire,
bunches of corn were worn in the hats. Those who draw the plough are
called ‘Plough Bullocks,’ ‘Boggons’ or ‘Stots.’ They sometimes dance
a morris-or sword-dance, or act a play. At Haxey, they take a leading
part in the Twelfth day ‘Hood-game’ (p. 150). In Northants their faces
are blackened or reddled. The plough is generally accompanied by the
now familiar grotesques, ‘Bessy’ and the Fool or ‘Captain Cauf-Tail.’
In Northants there are two of each; the Fools have humps, and are
known as ‘Red Jacks’; there is also a ‘Master.’ In Lincolnshire,
reapers, threshers, and carters joined the procession. A contribution
to the <i>quête</i> is greeted with the cry of ‘Largess!’ and a churl
is liable to have the ground before his door ploughed up. Of old the
profits of the <i>quête</i> or ‘plow-gadrin’ went into the parish
chest, or as in Norfolk kept a ‘plow-light’ burning in the church. A
sixteenth century pamphlet speaks of the ‘sensing the Ploughess’ on
Plough Monday. Jevons, 247, calls the rite a ‘worship of the plough’;
probably it rather represents an early spring perambulation of the
fields in which the divinity rode upon a plough, as elsewhere upon
a ship. A ploughing custom of putting a loaf in the furrow has been
noted. Plough Monday has also its water rite. The returning ploughman
was liable to be soused by the women, like the bearer of the ‘neck’
at harvest. Elsewhere, the women must get the kettle on before the
ploughman can reach the hearth, or pay forfeit.</p>

a Peebles version. Instead of George, a hero called Galatian fights the

The performers are invariably called ‘guizards.’ In a Falkirk version
the hero is Prince George of Ville. Hone, <i>E. D. B.</i>, says that
the hero is sometimes Galacheus or St. Lawrence. But in another Falkirk
version, part of which he prints, the name is Galgacus, and of this
both Galacheus and Galatian are probably corruptions, for Galgacus or
Calgacus was the leader of the Picts in their battle with Agricola at

some Christmas mummers seen at Mullion, Cornwall, in 1890-1. ‘Every one
naturally knows who the actors are, since there are not more than a few
hundred persons within several miles; but no one is supposed to know
who they are or where they come from, nor must any one speak to them,
nor they to those in the houses they visit. As far as I can remember
the performance is silent and dramatic; I have no recollection of
reciting.’ The dumb show is rare and probably a sign of decadence, but
the bit of rural etiquette is archaic and recurs in savage drama.</p>

an eighteenth-century Scotch version, and Mr. Gomme (<i>Nature</i>,
Dec. 23, 1897), says ‘some of the mummers, or maskers as the name
implies, formerly disguised themselves as animals—goats, oxen, deer,
foxes and horses being represented at different places where details
of the mumming play have been recorded.’ Nowadays, Beelzebub generally
carries a club and a ladle or frying-pan, with which he makes the
<i>quête</i>. At Newport and Eccleshall he has a bell fastened on
his back; at Newbold he has a black face. The ‘Fool’ figured in the
Manchester chap-book resembles Punch.</p>

Spring’ who fight and are slain in the Dorset (A) version; but there
the names are. Mr. Gomme (<i>Nature</i> for Dec. 23, 1897) finds in
certain mumming costumes preserved in the Anthropological Museum at
Cambridge and made of paper scales, a representation of leaves of
trees. Mr. Ordish, I believe, finds in them the scales of the dragon
(<i>F. L.</i> iv. 163). Some scepticism may be permitted as to these
conjectures. In most places the dress represents little but rustic
notions of the ornamental. Cf. Thomas Hardy, <i>The Return of the
Native</i>, bk. ii. ch. 3: ‘The girls could never be brought to respect
tradition in designing and decorating the armour: they insisted on
attaching loops and bows of silk and velvet in any situation pleasing
to their taste. Gorget, gusset, bassinet, cuirass, gauntlet, sleeve,
all alike in the view of these feminine eyes were practicable spaces
whereon to sew scraps of fluttering colour.’ The usual costume of the
sword-dancers, as we have seen (p. 200), was a clean white smock, and
probably that of the mummers is based upon this.</p>

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_768" href="#FNanchor_768" class="label">[768]</a> In the Dorset (A) version, the king of Egypt is
‘Anthony’ and the doctor ‘Mr. Martin Dennis.’ Conceivably these are
reminiscences of St. Anthony of Padua and St. Denys of France. The
Revesby Plough Monday play (cf. p. 208) has also an ‘Anthony.’ The
‘Seven Champions’ do not appear in the English sword-dances described
in ch. ix, but the morris-dancers at Edgemond wake used to take that
name (Burne-Jackson, 491). Mrs. Nina Sharp writes in <i>F. L. R.</i>
iii. 1. 113: ‘I was staying at Minety, near Malmesbury, in Wilts (my
cousin is the vicar), when the mummers came round (1876). They went
through a dancing fight in two lines opposed to each other—performed
by the Seven Champions of Christendom. There was no St. George, and
they did not appear to have heard of the Dragon. When I inquired for
him, they went through the performance of drawing a tooth—the tooth
produced, after great agony, being a horse’s. The mummers then carried
into the hall a bush gaily decorated with coloured ribbons.... [They]
were all in white smock frocks and masks. At Acomb, near York, I saw
very similar mummers a few years ago, but they distinguished St.
George, and the Dragon was a prominent person. There was the same
tooth-drawing, and I think the Dragon was the patient, and was brought
back to life by the operation.’ I wonder whether the ‘Seven Champions’
were <i>named</i> or whether Mrs. Sharp <i>inferred them</i>. Anyhow,
there could not have been <i>seven</i> at Minety, without St. George.
The ‘bush’ is an interesting feature. According to C. R. Smith, <i>Isle
of Wight Words</i> (<i>Eng. Dial. Soc.</i> xxxii. 63) the mummers are
known in Kent as the ‘Seven Champions.’</p>

W. Budge, <i>The Martyrdom and Miracles of St. George of Cappadocia:
the Coptic Texts</i> (Oriental Text Series, 1888). In Rudder, <i>Hist.
of Gloucestershire</i>, 461, and <i>Gloucester F. L.</i> 47, is printed
an English version of the legend, apparently used for reading in
church on the Sunday preceding St. George’s day, April 23. Cf. also
Gibbon (ed. Bury), ii. 472, 568; Hartland, <i>Perseus</i>, iii. 38;

<i>Introduction</i> to Reimbot von Durne’s <i>Der heilige Georg</i>
(1896). Gibbon identified St. George with the Arian bishop George of
Cappadocia, and the dragon with Athanasius. This view has been recently
revived with much learning by J. Friedrich in <i>Sitzb. Akad. Wiss.
München</i> (<i>phil.-hist. Kl.</i>), 1899, ii. 2. Pope Gelasius
(†495) condemned the <i>Passio</i> as apocryphal and heretical, but
he admits the historical existence of the saint, whose cult indeed was
well established both in East and West in the fifth century. Budge
tries to find an historical basis for him in a young man at Nicomedia
who tore down an edict during the persecution of Diocletian (†303),
and identifies his torturer Dadianus with the co-emperor Galerius.</p>

τοῦ πολλοῦ δήμου εἷσ· ἐν αὐταῖς δέ ταῖς ἑπτὰ σπουδαῖον μὲν οὐδὲν οὐδὲ
ἀγοραῖον διοικήσασθαί μοι συγκεχώρηται, πίνειν δὲ καὶ μεθύειν καὶ βοᾶν
καὶ παίζειν καὶ κυβεύειν καὶ ἄρχοντας καθίσταναι καὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας
εὐωχεῖν καὶ γυμνὸν ἄδειν καὶ κροτεῖν ὑποτρέμοντα, ἐνίοτε δὲ καὶ ἐς
ὕδωρ ψυχρὸν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν ὠθεῖσθαι ἀσβόλῳ κεχρισμένον τὸ πρόσωπον, ταῦτα
ἐφεῖταί μοι ποιεῖν; and again: εὐωχώμεθα δὲ ἤδη καὶ κροτῶμεν καὶ ἐπὶ
τῆ ἑορτῆ ἐλευθεριάζωμεν, εἲτα πεττεύωμεν ἐς τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἐπὶ καρύων
καὶ βασιλέας χειροτονῶμεν καὶ πειθαρχῶμεν αὐτοῖσ· οὕτω γὰρ ἂν τὴν
παροιμίαν ἐπαληθεύσαιμι, ἥ φησι, παλίμπαιδας τοὺς γέροντας γίγνεσθαι.
The ducking is curiously suggestive of western festival customs, but I
do not feel sure whether it was the image of Saturn that was ducked or
the <i>rex</i> with whom he appears to half, and only half, identify
himself. Frazer, iii. 140, lays stress on the primitive sacrificial
character of the ‘rex,’ who is said still to have been annually slain
in Lower Moesia at the beginning of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>;

<i>Fasti</i> of Philocalus drawn up in 354, opens with the entry
‘viii kl. ianu. natus Christus in Bethleem Iudeae.’ December 25 was
therefore kept as the birthday at least as early as 353. Usener,
i. 267, argued that the change must have taken place in this very
year, because Liberius, while veiling Marcellina, the sister of St.
Ambrose, on the Epiphany, spoke of the day as ‘natalem Sponsi tui’
(<i>de Virginibus</i>, iii. 1, in <i>P. L.</i> xvi. 219). But it is
not proved either that this event took place in 363, or that it was on
Epiphany rather than Christmas day. Liberius refers to the Marriage
at Cana and the Feeding of the Five Thousand. But the first allusion
is directly led up to by the <i>sponsalia</i> of Marcellina, and both
events, although at a later date commemorated at Epiphany, may have
belonged to Christmas at Rome, before Epiphany made its appearance
(Duchesne, <i>Bulletin critique</i> (1890), 41). Usener adds that
Liberius built the <i>Basilica Liberii</i>, also known as <i>Sta.
Maria ad Praesepe</i> or <i>Sta. Maria Maggiore</i>, which is still
a great station for the Christmas ceremonies, in honour of the new
feast. But Duchesne shows that the dedication to St. Mary only dates
from a rebuilding in the fifth century, that the <i>praesepe</i> cannot
be traced there before the seventh, and that the original Christmas
<i>statio</i> was at St. Peter’s.</p>

Armenian bishop Hippolytus in <i>Bodl. Armen. Marsh</i> 467, f. 338<sup>a</sup>,
‘as many as were disobedient have divided the two feasts.’ According
to the <i>Catechism of the Syrian Doctors</i> in the same MS., Sahak
asked Afrem why the churches feast Dec. 25: the teacher replied, ‘The
Roman world does so from idolatry, because of the worship of the Sun.
And on the 25th of Dec., which is the first of Qanûn; when the day
made a beginning out of the darkness they feasted the Sun with great
joy, and declared that day to be the nuptials [? ‘natals,’ but cf. p.
241, n. 1] of the Sun. However, when the Son of God was born of the
Virgin, they celebrated the same feast, although they had turned from
their idols to God. And when their bishops (<i>or</i> primates) saw
this, they proceeded to take the Feast of the Birth of Christ, which
was on the sixth of January, and placed it there (viz. on Dec. 25). And
they abrogated the feast of the Sun, because it (the Sun) was nothing,
as we said before.’ Mommsen, <i>C. I. L.</i> i<sup>2</sup>. 338, quotes to the

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_840" href="#FNanchor_840" class="label">[840]</a> Most of these dates were in the spring (Duchesne, 247).
As late as †243 the Pseudo-Cyprianic <i>de Pascha computus</i> gives
March 28. On the other hand, December 25 is given early in the third
century by Hippolytus, <i>Comm. super Danielem</i>, iv. 23 (p. 243, ed.
Bonwetsch, 1897), although the text has been suspected of interpolation
(Hilgenfeld, in <i>Berlin. phil. Wochenschrift</i>, 1897, p. 1324,
s.). Ananias of Shirak (†600-50), <i>Hom. de Nat.</i> (transl. in
<i>Expositor</i>, Nov. 1890), says that the followers of Cerinthus
first separated the birth and baptism: cf. Conybeare, <i>Key of
Truth</i>, cliv. This is further explained by Paul of Taron (ob. 1123),
<i>adv. Theopistum</i>, 222 (quoted Conybeare, clvi), who says that
Artemon calculated the dates of the Annunciation as March 25 and the
Birth as December 25, ‘the birth, not however of the Divine Being, but
only of the mere man.’ Both Cerinthus (end of 1st cent.) and Artemon
(†202-17) appear to have held Adoptionist tenets: cf. Schaff, iv.
465, 574. Paul adds that Artemon calculated the dates from those for
the conception and nativity of John the Baptist. This implies that St.
John Baptist’s day was already June 24 by †200. It was traditional on
that day by St. Augustine’s time, ‘Hoc maiorum traditione suscepimus’
(<i>Sermo</i> ccxcii. 1, in Migne, <i>P. L.</i> xxxviii. 1320). The
six months’ interval between the two nativities may be inferred from
<i>St. Luke</i> i. 26. St. Augustine refers to the symbolism of their
relation to each other, and quotes with regard to their position on
the solstices the words ascribed to the Baptist in <i>St. John</i>
iii. 30 ‘illum oportet crescere, me autem minui’ (<i>Sermo</i> cxciv.
2; cclxxxvii. 3; cclxxxviii. 5; Migne, <i>P. L.</i> xxxviii. 1016,
1302, 1306). Duchesne, 250, conjectures that the varying dates of West
(Dec. 25) and East (Jan. 6) depended on a similar variation in the
date assigned to the Passion, it being assumed in each case that the
life of Christ must have been a complete circle, and that therefore
he must have died on the anniversary of his conception in the womb.
Thus St. Augustine (<i>in Heptat.</i> ii. 90) upbraids the Jews, ‘non
coques agnum in lacte matris suae.’ March 25 was widely accepted for
the Passion from Tertullian onwards, and certain Montanists held to the
date of April 6. Astronomy makes it impossible that March 25 can be
historically correct, and therefore the whole calculation, if Duchesne
is right, probably started from an arbitrary identification of a
Christian date with the spring equinox, just as, if Ananias of Shirak
is right, it started from a similar identification of another such
date with the summer solstice. But it seems just as likely that the
birth was fixed first, and the Annunciation and St. John Baptist’s day
calculated back from that. If the Passion had been the starting-point,
would not the feast of Christmas, as distinct from the traditional date
for the event, have become a movable one?</p>

two ways, besides drawing the parallel with St. John already quoted.
Christ is <i>lux e tenebris</i>: ‘quoniam ipsa infidelitas quae totum
mundum vice noctis obtexerat, minuenda fuerat fide crescente; ideo die
Natalis Domini nostri Iesu Christi, et nox incipit perpeti detrimenta,
et dies sumere augmenta’ (<i>Sermo</i> cxc. 1 in <i>P. L.</i> xxxviii.
1007). He is also <i>sponsus procedens de thalamo suo</i> (<i>Sermo</i>
cxcii. 3; cxcv. 3, in <i>P. L.</i> xxxviii. 1013, 1018). Following
this Caesarius or another calls Christmas the <i>dies nuptialis
Christi</i>, on which ‘sponsae suae Ecclesiae adiunctus est’ (<i>Serm.
Pseudo-Aug.</i> cxvi. 2, in <i>P. L.</i> xxxix. 1975). Cumont, i.
355, gives other examples of <i>Le Soleil Symbole du Christ</i>

Iustitiae</i> from <i>Malachi</i>, iv. 2.</p>

religiose facere putant, ut priusquam ad B. Petri apostoli basilicam,

quibus ad suggestum areae superioris ascenditur, converso corpore ad
nascentem se solem reflectant, et curvatis cervicibus, in honorem
se splendidi orbis inclinent. Quod fieri partim ignorantiae vitio,
partim paganitatis spiritu, multum tabescimus et dolemus.’ Eusebius,
<i>Sermo</i> xxii. περὶ ἀστρονόμων (<i>P. G.</i> lxxxvi. 453),
also refers to the adoration of the sun by professing Christians.
The ‘tentator’ of Leo and the ‘heretici’ of Augustine are probably
Manichaeus and his followers, against whose sun-worship Augustine
argues at length in <i>Contra Faustum</i>, xx (<i>Corp. Script.

Fair’ at Charlton, Kent, on St. Luke’s Day, Oct. 18. A king and queen
were chosen, who went in procession to the church, wearing horns. The
visitors wore masks or women’s clothes, and played practical jokes with
water. Rams’ horns were sold at the fair, which lasted three days, and
the gilt on the gingerbread took the same shape. It will be remembered
that the symbol of St. Luke in Christian art is a horned ox.</p>

They should not touch the ground (Grimm, iii. 1207). With this taboo
compare that described by ancient writers, probably on the authority
of Posidonius, as existing in a cult of a god identified with Dionysus
amongst the Namnites on the west coast of Gaul. A temple on an island
was unroofed and reroofed by the priestesses annually. Did one of
them drop her materials on the ground, she was torn to pieces by her
companions (Rhys, <i>C. H.</i> 196). They are replaced on Candlemas by
snowdrops, or, according to Herrick, ‘the greener box.’ In Shropshire a

of Wilts</i>, ‘Mr. Anthony Hinton, one of the officers of the Earle
of Pembroke, did inoculate, not long before the late civill warres
(ten yeares or more), a bud of Glastonbury Thorne, on a thorne, at
his farm house, at Wilton, which blossoms at Christmas, as the other
did. My mother has had branches of them for a flower-pott, several
Christmasses, which I have seen. Elias Ashmole, Esq., in his notes upon
<i>Theatrum Chymicum</i>, saies that in the churchyard at Glastonbury
grew a walnutt tree, that did putt out young leaves at Christmas, as
doth the King’s Oake in the New Forest. In Parham Park, in Suffolk
(Mr. Boutele’s), is a pretty ancient thorne, that blossomes like
that at Glastonbury; the people flock hither to see it on Christmas
day. But in the rode that leades from Worcester to Droitwiche is a
black thorne hedge at Clayes, half a mile long or more, that blossoms
about Christmas-day for a week or more together. Dr. Ezerel Tong
sayd that about Rumly-Marsh in Kent, are thornes naturally like that
near Glastonbury. The Soldiers did cutt downe that near Glastonbury:
the stump remaines.’ Specimens are still found about Glastonbury of
<i>Crataegus oxyacantha praecox</i>, a winter-flowering variety of
hawthorn: some of the alleged slips from the Glastonbury thorn appear,
however, to be <i>Prunus communis</i>, or blackthorn. A writer in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for 1753 reports that the opponents of the
‘New Style’ introduced in 1752 were encouraged by the refusal of the
thorns at Glastonbury and Quainton in Buckinghamshire to flower before
Old Christmas day. A Somerset woman told a writer in 3 <i>N. Q.</i>
ix. 33 that the buds of the thorns burst into flower at midnight on
Christmas Eve, ‘As they comed out, you could hear ‘um haffer.’</p>

<p class="hang">On no word has amateur philology been more riotous.
It has been derived from ‘au gui menez,’ ‘à gui l’an neuf,’ ‘au
gueux menez,’ ‘Hálig monath,’ ἁγία μήνη, ‘Homme est né,’ and the
like. Tille thinks that the whole of December was formerly Hogmanay,
and derives from <i>monâth</i> and either *<i>hoggva</i>, ‘hew,’
<i>hag</i>, ‘witch,’ or <i>hog</i>, ‘pig.’ Nicholson tries the other
end, and traces <i>auguilanleu</i> to the Spanish <i>aguinaldo</i>
or <i>aguilando</i>, ‘a New Year’s gift.’ This in turn he makes the
gerund of *<i>aguilar</i>, an assumed corruption of <i>alquilar</i>,
‘to hire oneself out.’ Hogmanay will thus mean properly ‘handsel’ or
hiring-money,’ and the first Monday in the New Year is actually called
in Scotland ‘Handsel Monday.’ This is plausible, but, although no
philologist, I think a case might be made out for regarding the terms
as corruptions of the Celtic <i>Nos Galan-gaeaf</i>, ‘the night of the
winter Calends’ (Rhys, 514). This is All Saints’ eve, while the Manx
‘Hob dy naa’ <i>quête</i> is on Hollantide (November 12; cf. p. 230).</p>

In Germany <i>Heilwag</i> similarly drawn at Christmas is medicinal
(Grimm, iv. 1810). Pembroke folk sprinkle each other on New Year’s Day
(<i>F. L.</i> iii. 263). St. Martin of Braga condemns amongst Kalends
customs ‘panem in fontem mittere (Appendix N, No. xxiii), and this
form of well-cult survives at Christmas in the Tyrol (Jahn, 283) and
in France (Müller, 500). Tertullian chaffs the custom of early bathing
at the <i>Saturnalia</i> (Appendix N, No. ii). Gervase of Tilbury
(ed. Liebrecht, ii. 12) mentions an English belief (†1200) in a
wonder-working Christmas dew. This Tille (<i>Y. and C.</i> 168) thinks
an outgrowth from the Advent chant <i>Rorate coeli</i>, but it seems
closely parallel to the folk belief in May-dew.</p>

vocabitur rex et sedebit ad magnam mensam, et scilicet sedebit ad

A custom of feasting on the tombs of the dead on the day of St. Peter
de Cathedra (Feb. 22) is condemned by the <i>Council of Tours</i>
(567), c. 23 (Maassen, i. 133) ‘sunt etiam qui in festivitate cathedrae
domui Petri apostoli cibos mortuis offerunt, et post missas redeuntes
ad domos proprias, ad gentilium revertuntur errores, et post corpus
Domini, sacratas daemoni escas accipiunt.’ I do not doubt that the
Germano-Keltic tribes had their spring <i>Todtenfest</i>, but the date
Feb. 22 seems determined by the Roman <i>Parentalia</i> extending
from Feb. 13 to either Feb. 21 (<i>Feralia</i>) or Feb. 22 (<i>Cara
Cognatio</i>): cf. Fowler, 306. The ‘cibi’ mentioned by the council of
Tours seem to have been offered in the house, like the winter offerings
described below; but there is also evidence for similar Germano-Keltic
offerings on the tomb or howe itself; and these were often accompanied
by <i>dadsisas</i> or dirges; cf. Saupe, <i>Indiculus</i>, 5-9. Saupe
considers the <i>spurcalia in Februario</i>, explained above (p. 114)
as a ploughing rite, to be funereal.</p>

He adds ‘acta sunt autem haec omnia, ut maiorum memoria prodit, die
Kal. Octobris, qui dies erroris, religiosorum sanctione virorum
mutati sunt in ieiunia et orationes, oblationes quoque omnium nos
praecedentium christianorum.’ This is probably a myth to account for
the harvest <i>Todtenfest</i>, which may more naturally be thought
of as transferred with the agricultural rites from November. For the
mediaeval <i>Gemeinwoche</i>, beginning on the Sunday after Michaelmas,
was common to Germany, and not confined to Saxony. Michaelmas, the
feast of angels, known at Rome in the sixth century, and in Germany by
the ninth, also adapts itself to the notion of a <i>Todtenfest</i>.</p>

Other Kalends notions have taken on a Christian colouring. The
miraculous events of Christmas night are rooted in the conception
that the Kalends must abound in all good things, in order that the
coming year may do so. But allusions to Christian legend have been
worked into and have transformed them. On Christmas night bees sing
(Brand, i. 3), and water is turned into wine (Grimm, iv. 1779, 1809).
While the genealogy is sung at the midnight mass, hidden treasures
are revealed (Grimm, iv. 1840). Similarly, the cattle of heathen
masters naturally shared in the Kalends good cheer; whence a Christian
notion that they, and in particular the ox and the ass, witnesses
of the Nativity, can speak on that night, and bear testimony to the
good or ill-treatment of the farmers (Grimm, iv. 1809, 1840); cf.
the <i>Speculum Perfectionis</i>, c. 114, ed. Sabatier, 225 ‘quod

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_990" href="#FNanchor_990" class="label">[990]</a> The feast lasted from Vespers on the vigil to Vespers
on the day of the Circumcision. The <i>Hauptmoment</i> was evidently
the <i>Magnificat</i> in the second Vespers. But what exactly took
place then? Did the cathedral precentor hand over the <i>baculus</i> to
the <i>dominus festi</i>, or was it last year’s <i>dominus festi</i>,
who now handed it over to his newly-chosen successor? Probably the
latter. The <i>dominus festi</i> is called at first Vespers ‘capam
redditurus’: doubtless the cope and <i>baculus</i> went together. The
<i>dominus festi</i> may have, as elsewhere, exercised disciplinary and
representative functions amongst the inferior clergy during the year.
His title I take to have been, as at Sens, <i>precentor stultorum</i>.
The order says, ‘si captus fuerit baculus’; probably it was left
to the chapter to decide whether the formal installation of the
<i>precentor</i> in church should take place in any particular year.</p>

<i>festorum libri</i> were in use elsewhere, e.g. at Amiens. Nisard,

written by ‘notaires’ to amuse the choir-boys, and cites a paper of
M. Carlier, canon of Sens, before the Historic Congress held at Sens
in 1850 in support of this view. Doubtless the <i>goliardi</i> wrote
such imitations (cf. the <i>missa lusorum</i> in Schmeller, <i>Carmina

his footnotes refer to Ducange, s. v. <i>Kalendae</i>. The ‘Preuves’
for his history are scattered through the <i>MSS. Picardie</i> in the

which are copies of the Beauvais office (Dreves, in <i>Stimmen aus

F. Bourquelot, in <i>Bulletin de la Soc. arch. de Sens</i> (1854),
vi. 171 (which also, unfortunately, I have not seen), and chants from
them are in Dreves, <i>Anal. Hymn.</i> xx. 229. But here Dreves seems
to speak of them as copies of Pacchiarotti’s MS. (<i>Egerton MS.</i>
2615). And Desjardins, 124, says that Grenier and Bourquelot used
extracts from eighteenth-century copies of Pacchiarotti’s MS. in the
library of M. Borel de Brétizel. Are these writers mistaken, or did
Grenier only see the copies, and take his description from Louvet? And
what has become of the twelfth-century MS.?</p>

other writers give the date of the ‘codex’ as twelfth century. But
500 years from 1733-6 only bring it to the thirteenth century. The
mistake is due to the fact that the <i>first</i> edition of Ducange,
in which the ‘codex’ is not mentioned, is of 1678. Clément, 158,
appears to have no knowledge of the MS. but what he read in Ducange;
and it is not quite clear what he means when he says that it ‘d’après

n’ayant aucune autorité historique et encore bien moins religieuse.’

quare in hac die fit festum stultorum.... Ante adventum Domini
celebrabant festa quae vocabant Parentalia; et in illa die spem
ponebant credentes quod si in illa die bene eis accideret, quod
similiter in toto anno. Hoc festum voluit removere Ecclesia quod contra
fidem est. Et quia extirpare omnino non potuit, festum illud permittit
et celebrat illud festum celeberrimum ut aliud demittatur: et ideo in
matutinali officio leguntur lectiones quae dehortantur ab huiusmodi
quae sunt contra fidem (cf. p. 245). Et si ista die ab ecclesia quaedam
fiunt praeter fidem, nulla tamen contra fidem. Et ideo ludos qui sunt
contra fidem permutavit in ludos qui non sunt contra fidem.’ There is
clearly a confusion here between the Roman <i>Parentalia</i> (Feb.
13-22) and <i>Kalendae</i> (Jan. 1). On William of Auxerre, whose work
remains in MS., cf. Lebeuf, in P. Desmolets, <i>Mémoires</i>, iii. 339;
<i>Nouvelle Biographie universelle</i>, s. n. He was bishop of Auxerre,
translated to Paris in 1220, ob. 1223. He must be distinguished from
another William of Auxerre, who was archdeacon of Beauvais (†1230),
and wrote a comment on Petrus Lombardus, printed at Paris in 1500
(Gröber, <i>Grundriss der röm. Philologie</i>, ii. 1. 239).</p>

proceedings on the day after the Nativity are probably explained by
the election of the precentor on that day (after Vespers). The victims
ducked may have failed to be present at the election; but cf. the
Easter <i>prisio</i> (ch. vii).</p>

22nd session (1562) it renewed the decrees of popes and councils ‘de

no specific mention of ‘fatui’ (<i>Can. et Decr. Sacros. Oec. Conc.

Vicars choral make their appearance in the eleventh century as choir
substitutes for non-resident canons. At Lincoln they got benefactions
from about 1190, and in the thirteenth century formed a regularly

raising funds for choir suppers, known at Auxerre and in Auvergne,
and not quite extinct in the eighteenth century. It has a certain
analogy to the <i>Deposuit</i>. From Christmas to Epiphany the Psalm
<i>Memento</i> was sung at Vespers, and the anthem <i>De fructu
ventris</i> inserted in it. When this began the ruler of the choir
advanced and presented a bouquet to some canon or <i>bourgeois</i> as
a sign that the choir would sup with him. This was called ‘annonce
en forme d’antienne,’ and the suppers <i>defructus</i>. The <i>C.
of Narbonne</i> (1551), c. 47, forbade ‘parochis&nbsp;...&nbsp;ne&nbsp;...&nbsp;ad
commessationes quas defructus appellant, ullo modo parochianos suos
admittant, nec permittant quempiam canere ut dicunt: Memento, Domine,

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_1166" href="#FNanchor_1166" class="label">[1166]</a> Dulaure, <i>Hist. des Environs de Paris</i>, iii. 509,
quotes a legend to the effect that the very ass ridden by Christ came
ultimately to Verona, died there, was buried in a wooden effigy at
S<sup>ta</sup>-Maria in Organo, and honoured by a yearly procession. He guesses
at this as the origin of the Beauvais and other <i>fêtes</i>. Didron,
<i>Annales arch.</i> xv. 377, xvi. 33, found that nothing was known
of this legend at Verona, though such a statue group as is described
above apparently existed in the church named. Dulaure gives as his
authorities F. M. Misson, <i>Nouveau Voyage d’ Italie</i> (1731), i.
164; <i>Dict. de l’ Italie</i>, i. 56. Misson’s visit to Verona was
in 1687, although the passage was not printed in the first edition
(1691) of his book. It is in the English translation of 1714 (i. 198).
<i>His</i> authority was a French merchant (M. Montel) living in
Verona, who had often seen the procession. In <i>Cenni intorno all’
origine e descrizione della Festa che annualmente si celebra in Verona
l’ ultimo Venerdì del Carnovale, comunamente denominata Gnoccolare</i>
(1818), 75, is a mention of the ‘asinello del vecchio padre Sileno’
which served as a mount for the ‘Capo de’ Maccheroni.’ This is probably
Misson’s procession, but there is no mention of the legend in any of
the eighteenth-century accounts quoted in the pamphlet. Rienzi was
likened to an ‘Abbate Asinino’ (Gibbon, vii. 269).</p>

fourteenth-century <i>Missal</i> and sixteenth-century <i>Breviary</i>;
also in the modern Greek Church at Moscow where until recently the Czar
held the bridle. But there is no ass, as he says, in the Palm Sunday
ceremony described in the <i>Peregrinatio Silviae</i> (Duchesne, 486).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_1169" href="#FNanchor_1169" class="label">[1169]</a> A peeress of the realm lately stated that this custom
had been introduced in recent years into the Anglican church. Denials
were to hand, and an amazing conflict of evidence resulted. Is there
any proof that the <i>Palmesel</i> was ever an English ceremony at all?
The Hereford riding of 1706 (cf. <i>Representations</i>) was not in
the church. Brand, i. 73, quotes <i>A Dialogue: the Pilgremage of Pure
Devotyon</i> (1551?), ‘Upon Palme Sondaye they play the foles sadely,
drawynge after them an Asse in a rope, when they be not moche distante
from the Woden Asse that they drawe.’ Clearly this, like Googe’s
translation of Naogeorgus, is a description of contemporary continental
Papistry. W. Fulke, <i>The Text of the New Testament</i> (ed. 1633), 76
(<i>ad Marc.</i> xi. 8) quotes a note of the Rheims translation to the
effect that in memory of the entry into Jerusalem is a procession on
Palm Sunday ‘with the blessed Sacrament reverently carried as it were
Christ upon the Asse,’ and comments, ‘But it is pretty sport, that you
make the Priest that carrieth the idoll, to supply the roome of the
Asse on which Christ did ride.... Thus you turn the holy mysterie of
Christ’s riding to Jerusalem to a May-game and Pageant-play.’ Fulke,
who lived 1538-89, is evidently unaware that there was an ass, as well
as the priest, in the procession, from which I infer that the custom
was not known in England. Not that this consideration would weigh with
the mediaevally-minded curate, who is as a rule only too ready to make
up by the ceremonial inaccuracy of his mummeries for the offence which
they cause to his congregation.</p>

Circumcision at Paris (cf. p. 276), Bishop Eudes de Sully says (<i>P.
L.</i> ccxii. 73) ‘quoniam festivitas beati protomartyris Stephani
eiusdem fere subiacebat dissolutionis et temeritatis incommodo, nec
ita solemniter, sicut decebat et martyris merita requirebant, in
Ecclesia Parisiensi consueverat celebrari, nos, qui eidem martyri
sumus specialiter debitores, quoniam in Ecclesia Bituricensi patronum
habuerimus, in cuius gremio ab ineunte aetate fuimus nutriti; de
voluntate et assensu dilectorum nostrorum Hugonis decani et capituli
Parisiensis, festivitatem ipsam ad statum reducere regularem, eumque
magnis Ecclesiae solemnitatibus adnumerare decrevimus; statuentes ut
in ipso festo tantum celebritatis agatur, quantum in ceteris festis
annualibus fieri consuevit.’ Eudes de Sully made a donative to the
canons and clerks present at Matins on the feast, which his successor
Petrus de Nemore confirmed in 1208 (<i>P. L.</i> ccxii. 91). Dean Hugo
Clemens instigated a similar reform of St. John’s day (see p. 276).</p>

needed reforming, as well as that of St. John (A. Chéruel, <i>Hist.

(Gasté, 47) ‘praefati Domini capitulantes ordinaverunt quod in festis

before the visitors of the convent of St. Radegund in Poitou, that
the abbess ‘vittam de auro exornatam idem neptae suae superflue
fecerit, barbaturias intus eo quod celebraverit.’ Ducange, s. v.
<i>Barbatoriae</i>, finds here a reference to some kind of masquing,
and Peter of Blois, <i>Epist.</i> 14, certainly uses <i>barbatores</i>
as a synonym for <i>mimi</i>. The M. G. H. editors of Gregory, however,
explain ‘<i>barbatoria</i>’ as ‘<i>primam barbam ponere</i>’ the sense
borne by the term in Petronius, <i>Sat.</i> lxxiii. 6. The abbess’s
niece had probably no beard, but may not the reference be to the
cutting of the hair of a novice when she takes the vows?</p>

proclamation of July 22, 1540, to the same effect. Johan Bale in his
<i>Yet a Course at the Romyshe Foxe</i> (1542), says that if Bonner’s
censure of those who lay aside certain ‘auncyent rytes’ is justified,
‘then ought my Lorde also to suffer the same selfe ponnyshment,
for not goynge abought with Saynt Nycolas clarkes.’ Thomas Becon,
<i>Catechism</i>, 320 (ed. Parker Soc.), compares a bishop who does
not preach, a ‘dumb dog,’ to a ‘Nicholas bishop.’ The <i>Articles</i>
put to bishop Gardiner in 1550 required him to declare ‘that the
counterfeiting St. Nicholas, St. Clement, St. Catherine and St. Edmund,
by children, heretofore brought into the church, was a mockery and
foolishness’ (Froude, iv. 550).</p>

St.] Nicolas Olyffe in Bredstret.’ Warton, iv. 237, says that during
Mary’s reign Hugh Rhodes, a gentleman or musician of the Chapel royal,
printed in black letter quarto a poem of thirty-six octave stanzas,
entitled <i>The Song of the Chyldbysshop, as it was songe before the
queenes maiestie in her privie chamber at her manour of saynt James
in the Feeldes on Saynt Nicholas day and Innocents day this yeare

fulsome panegyric on the queen’s devotion, in which she is compared to
Judith, Esther, the Queen of Sheba, and the Virgin Mary,’ but no copy
of it is now known; cf. F. J. Furnivall, <i>The Babees Book</i> (E. E.

celebrates the wit of a ‘godly matron,’ Mrs. Gertrude Crockhay, who
shut ‘the foolish popish Saint Nicholas’ out of her house in this year,
and told her brother-in-law, Dr. Mallet, when he remonstrated, that she
had heard of men robbed by ‘Saint Nicholas’s clerks.’ This was a slang
term for thieves, of whom, as of children, St. Nicholas was the patron;
for the reason of which cf. <i>Golden Legend</i>, ii. 119. Another
procession forbidden by the proclamation of 1541 was also revived
in 1556; cf. <i>Machyn’s Diary</i>, 119 ‘[The xxiv day of November,

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_1324" href="#FNanchor_1324" class="label">[1324]</a> At Mainz, not only the <i>pueri</i>, but also the
<i>diaconi</i> and the <i>sacerdotes</i>, had their <i>episcopus</i>
(Dürr, 71). On the other hand at Vienne the term used at all the
feasts, of the <i>triduum</i> and on January 1 and 6, was <i>rex</i>
(Pilot de Thorey, <i>Usages, Fêtes et Coutumes en Dauphiné</i>, i.
179). The Boy Bishops received, for their brief day, all the external
marks of honour paid to real bishops. They are alleged to have
occasionally enjoyed more solid privileges. Louvet (<i>Hist. et Ant.
de Beauvais</i>, cited Rigollot, 142), says that at Beauvais the right
of presentation to chapter benefices falling vacant on Innocents’
Day fell to the <i>pueri</i>. Jean Van der Muelen or Molanus (<i>De
Canonicis</i> (1587), ii. 43) makes a similar statement as to Cambrai:
‘Immo personatus hic episcopus in quibusdam locis reditus, census
et capones, annue percipit: alibi mitram habet, multis episcoporum
mitris sumptuosiorem. In Cameracensi ecclesia visus est vacantem, in
mense episcopi, praebendam, quasi iure ad se devoluto, conferre; quam
collationem beneficii vere magnifici, reverendissimus praesul, cum puer
grato animo, magistrum suum, bene de ecclesia meritum, nominasset,
gratam et raram habuit.’ At Mainz lost tradition had it that if an
Elector died during the tenure of office by a Boy Bishop, the revenues
<i>sede vacante</i> would fall to him. Unfortunately the chapter and
verse of history disprove this (Dürr, 67, 79). On the other hand it
is certain that the Boy Bishops assumed the episcopal privilege of
coinage. Rigollot, 52 sqq., describes and figures a long series of
fifteenth-and sixteenth-century coins or medals mostly struck by
‘bishops’ of the various churches and monastic houses of Amiens. They
are the more interesting, because some of them bear ‘fools’ as devices,
and thus afford another proof of the relations between the feasts of
Boys and Fools. Lille <i>monetae</i> of the sixteenth century are
figured by Vanhende, <i>Numismatique Lilloise</i>, 256, and others
from Laon by C. Hidé, in <i>Bull. de la Soc. acad. de Laon</i>, xiii.
126. Some of Rigollot’s specimens seem to have belonged, not to Boy
Bishops, but to <i>confréries</i>, who struck them as ‘jetons de
présence’ (Chartier, <i>L’ancien Chapitre de N.-D. de Paris</i>, 178);
and probably this is also the origin of the pieces found at Bury St.
Edmunds, which have nothing in their devices to connect them with a Boy
Bishop (Rimbault, xxvi).</p>

a ‘jeu de personnages,’ and this might have been a mere burlesque
consecration. However, ‘jeu de personnages’ generally implies something
distinctly dramatic (cf. ch. xxiv). It recurs in the Sens order of
1511. The Beauvais <i>Daniel</i> was possibly played at a Feast of
Fools: at Tours a <i>Prophetae</i> and a <i>miraculum</i> appear
under similar conditions; at Autun a <i>Herod</i> gave a name to the

vulgariter <i>Cent Drutz</i>, actenus observatum in nostra dyocesi,

illius ludi masculos iuvenes habitu muliebri et deducebant eos
processionaliter ad quendam quem vocabant priorem dicti ludi, cum

and the <i>prior</i> here look like a <i>société joyeuse</i>, but the
‘ludus cenicus’ was probably less a regular play than a dramatized bit

Grandisson</i>, ii. 1055, <i>Litera pro iniqua fraternitate de
Brothelyngham</i>. ‘Ad nostrum, siquidem, non sine inquietudine
gravi, pervenit auditum, quod in Civitate nostra Exonie secta quedam
abhominabilis quorundam hominum malignorum, sub nomine Ordinis, quin
pocius erroris, de Brothelyngham, procurante satore malorum operum,
noviter insurrexit; qui, non Conventum sed conventiculam facientes
evidenter illicitam et suspectam, quemdam lunaticum et delirum,
ipsorum utique operibus aptissime congruentem, sibi, sub Abbatis
nomine, prefecerunt, ipsumque Monachali habitu induentes ac in Theatro
constitutum velut ipsorum idolum adorantes, ad flatum cornu, quod
sibi statuerunt pro campana, per Civitatis eiusdem vicos et plateas,
aliquibus iam elapsis diebus, cum maxima equitum et peditum multitudine
commitarunt [sic]; clericos eciam laicos ceperunt eis obviam tunc
prestantes, ac aliquos de ipsorum domibus extraxerunt, et invitos
tam diu ausu temerario et interdum sacrilego tenuerunt, donec certas
pecuniarum summas loco sacrificii, quin verius sacrilegii, extorserunt
ab eisdem. Et quamvis hec videantur sub colore et velamine ludi, immo
ludibrii, attemptari, furtum est, tamen, proculdubio, in eo quod ab
invitis capitur et rapina.’ There is no such place as Brothelyngham,
but ‘brethelyng,’ ‘brethel,’ ‘brothel,’ mean ‘good-for-nothing’ (<i>N.

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_1422" href="#FNanchor_1422" class="label">[1422]</a> <i>Archaeologia</i>, xxxi. 29, 30, 118. The element
of semi-dramatic <i>spectacle</i> was already getting into the
fourteenth-century tournament. In 1331 Edward III and his court
rode to the lists in Cheap, ‘omnes splendido apparatu vestiti et
ad similitudinem Tartarorum larvati’ (<i>Annales Paulini</i> in
<i>Chron. Edw. I and II</i>, R. S. i. 354). In 1375 ‘rood dame Alice
Perrers, as lady of the sune, fro the tour of London thorugh Chepe;
and alwey a lady ledynge a lordys brydell. And thanne begun the grete
justes in Smythefeld’ (<i>London Chronicle</i>, 70). These ridings
closely resemble the ‘mummings’ proper. But they were a prelude to
<i>hastiludia</i>, which from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century
constantly grew less actual and more mimetic. In 1343 ‘fuerunt pulchra
hastiludia in Smethfield, ubi papa et duodecim cardinales per tres
dies contra quoscumque tirocinium habuerunt’ (Murimuth, <i>Continuatio
Chronicarum</i>, R. S. 146). And so on, through the jousts of Pallas
and Diana at the coronation of Henry VIII (Hall, 511) to the regular
Elizabethan ‘Barriers,’ such as the siege of the ‘Fortress of Perfect
Beauty’ by the ‘Four Foster Children of Desire,’ in which Sidney took
part in 1581.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_1423" href="#FNanchor_1423" class="label">[1423]</a> This seems to be clearly the sense of the <i>ludi
Domini Prioris</i> in the accounts of Durham Priory (cf. Appendix
E). The Scottish Exchequer Rolls between 1446 and 1478 contain such
entries as ‘iocis et ludis,’ ‘ludis et interludiis,’ ‘ioculancium et
ludencium,’ ‘ludos et disportus suos,’ where all the terms used, except
‘interludiis’ (cf. ch. xxiv), appear to be more or less equivalent
(<i>Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland</i>, i. ccxxxix). The
<i>Liber Niger</i> of Edward IV declares that in the <i>Domus</i> of
Henry I were allowed ‘ludi honesti,’ such as military sports ‘cum
ceterorum iocorum diversitate’ (<i>Household Ordinances</i>, 18).
‘Ioca’ is here exactly the French ‘jeux.’ Polydore Vergil, <i>Hist.
Anglica</i> (ed. Thysius), 772, says of the weddings of the children
of Henry VII ‘utriusque puellae nuptiae omnium generum ludis factae.’
For ‘disports’ cf. Hall, 774, ‘enterludes&nbsp;...&nbsp;maskes and disportes,’
and <i>Paston Letters</i>, iii. 314, where Lady Morley is said to have
ordered in 1476 that on account of her husband’s death there should
be at Christmas ‘non dysgysyngs, ner harpyng, ner lutyng, ner syngyn,
ner non lowde dysports, but pleyng at the tabyllys, and schesse, and
cards. Sweche dysports sche gave her folkys leve to play, and non
odyr.’ I find the first use of ‘revels’ in the Household Books of Henry
VII for 1493 (Collier, i. 50). In 1496 the same source gives the Latin
‘revelliones’ (Collier, i. 46). Sir Thomas Cawarden (1545) was patented
‘magister iocorum, revellorum et mascorum’ (Rymer, xv. 62). Another
synonym is ‘triumph,’ used in 1511 (Arnold, <i>Chronicle</i>, xlv). The
latter means properly a royal entry or reception; cf. ch. xxiii.</p>

‘maskers’: ‘At y<sup>e</sup> same tyme y<sup>e</sup> Comons of London made great sporte

but Stowe only names ‘pageants’ (cf. ch. xxiii). M. Paris, <i>Chronica
Maiora</i> (R. S. lvii), v. 269, mentions ‘vestium transformatarum

of England in 1251, but this probably means ‘a succession of rapidly

apparently included ‘a goodly commedy of Plautus’ and a mask. Away from
court in 1543 four players were committed to the Counter for ‘unlawful
disguising’ (<i>P. C. Acts</i>, i. 109, 110, 122). They surely played
interludes. It may be further noted (i) the elaborate disguisings of
Henry VII and Henry VIII, with much action and speechifying besides
the dancing, are difficult to distinguish when merely described from
interludes. What Hall, 518, calls in 1511 an interlude, seems from the
Revels Accounts (Brewer, ii. 1495) to have been really a disguising.
Hall, 641, speaks of a ‘disguisyng or play’ in 1522, and Cavendish,
<i>Life of Wolsey</i>, i. 136, of a ‘disguising or interlude’ in 1527;
(ii) a disguising or dance might be introduced, as <i>entr’acte</i> or
otherwise, into an interlude. In 1514 an interlude ‘conteyned a moresk
of vj persons and ij ladys’ (Collier, i. 68). In 1526 a moral play was
‘set forth with straunge deuises of Maskes and Morrishes’ (Hall, 719).
The interlude of <i>The Nature of the Four Elements</i> (early Hen.
VIII) has after the <i>dramatis personae</i> the direction, ‘Also yf ye

<p class="hang"><a id="Footnote_1458" href="#FNanchor_1458" class="label">[1458]</a> ‘Maske’ first appears in 1514 (Collier, i. 79 ‘iocorum
larvatorum, vocat. Maskes, Revelles, and Disguysings’); ‘masque’ is
not English until the seventeenth century (Evans, xiii). Skeat derives
through the French <i>masque</i>, <i>masquer</i>, <i>masquerer</i>, and
the Spanish <i>mascara</i>, <i>mascarada</i> (Ital. <i>mascherata</i>)
from the Arabic <i>maskharat</i>, a buffoon or droll (root
<i>sakhira</i>, ‘he ridiculed’). The original sense would thus be
‘entertainment’ and that of ‘face-mask’ (<i>larva</i>, ‘vizard,’
‘viser’) only derivative. But late Latin has already <i>masca</i>,
<i>talamasca</i> in this sense; e.g. Burchardus of Worms, <i>Coll.
Decretorum</i> (before 1024), bk. ii. c. 161 ‘nec larvas daemonum quas
vulgo Talamascas dicunt, ibi ante se ferri consentiat’; cf. Ducange,
s.v. <i>Talamasca</i>; Pfannenschmidt, 617, with some incorrect
etymology. And the French <i>masque</i> is always the face-mask and
never the performance; while <i>se masquier</i>, <i>masquillier</i>,
<i>maschurer</i>, are twelfth-to thirteenth-century words for
‘blacken,’ ‘dirty.’ I therefore prefer the derivation of Brotanek,
120, from a Germanic root represented by the M. E. <i>maskel</i>
‘stain’; and this has the further advantage of explaining ‘maskeler,’
‘maskeling,’ which appear, variously spelt, in documents of †1519-26.
Both terms signify the performance, and ‘maskeler’ the performer also
(Brotanek, 122). Face-masks were <i>de rigueur</i> in the Mask to a
late date. In 1618 John Chamberlain writes ‘the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn
came to court with their show, for I cannot call it a masque, seeing
they were not disguised, nor had vizards’ (Nichols, <i>James I</i>,
iii. 468).</p>

continued the same til the morrow after the feast of the Purification,

the first foundation, the fellows annually elected, about St. Edmund’s
day, in November, a Christmas lord, or lord of misrule, styled in
their registers <i>Rex Fabarum</i> and <i>Rex Regni Fabarum</i>; which
custom continued until the reformation of religion, and then, that
producing puritanism, and puritanism presbytery, the profession of it
looked upon such laudable and ingenious customs as popish, diabolical
and antichristian’; <i>Hist. and Antiq. of the Univ. of Oxford</i>,

David de la Hyde, in praise of ‘Mr. Jasper Heywood, about this time
King, or Christmas Lord, of the said Coll. [Merton] being it seems
the last that bore that commendable office. That custom hath been as
ancient for ought that I know as the College itself, and the election
of them after this manner. On the 19th of November, being the vigil of
S. Edmund, king and martyr, letters under seal were pretended to have
been brought from some place beyond sea, for the election of a king
of Christmas, or Misrule, sometimes called with us of the aforesaid
college, Rex Fabarum. The said letters being put into the hands of the
Bachelaur Fellows, they brought them into the Hall that night, and
standing, sometimes walking, round the fire, there reading the contents
of them, would choose the senior Fellow that had not yet borne that
office, whether he was a Doctor of Divinity, Law, or Physic, and being
so elected, had power put into his hands of punishing all misdemeanours
done in the time of Christmas, either by imposing exercises on the
juniors, or putting into the stocks at the end of the Hall any of the
servants, with other punishments that were sometimes very ridiculous.
He had always a chair provided for him, and would sit in great state
when any speeches were spoken, or justice to be executed, and so this
his authority would continue till Candlemas, or much about the time
that the Ignis Regentium was celebrated in that college’; <i>Life and
